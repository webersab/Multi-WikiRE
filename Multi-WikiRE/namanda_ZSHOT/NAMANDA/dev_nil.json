His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man.\n\n\n\nAndrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping.\n\n\n\nFor two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade \"scream and howl in pain\" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers \u00bb\n\n\n\nThey were true to their word.\n\n\n\nAndrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this\n\n\n\nThe blindfolded Andrade \"could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,\" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused.\n\n\n\n\"Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,\" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet.\n\n\n\nKidnappers creative with coercion\n\n\n\nFerocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.  Watch how the kidnappers choose their targets \u00bb\n\n\n\nPhoenix police say they have yet to witness the level of violence -- the beheadings, the bodies shoved in drums -- that their counterparts are seeing in Mexico City or the border town of Juarez.\n\n\n\n\"It gets close sometimes,\" said Lt. Lauri Burgett, who heads the Home Invasion and Kidnapping Enforcement squad.\n\n\n\nKidnappers will smash their victims' fingers with bricks, snip their backs open with wire cutters, carve them up with knives or simply shoot them.\n\n\n\n\"We've had them electrocuted. They set them in a tub with water and use kind of barbaric means and zap the tub. I think it was a battery hooked up,\" Burgett said.\n\n\n\nTwo kidnappings last year resulted in murders, she added, but it's not the norm.\n\n\n\nPhoenix police formed the HIKE squad in October after two years of unprecedented kidnapping numbers -- 357 in 2007 and 368 in 2008 -- gave the city the dubious distinction of being the nation's kidnapping capital. Home invasions were not far behind: 317 in 2007 and 337 in 2008.  See kidnapping numbers since 1999 \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"It's all about the money. And there's so much money to be made in this that you can't stop it, but you can try to reveal it, and then you can try to do something about it,\" Burgett said.\n\n\n\nThe task force has made dozens of arrests, but as of March 31, the city had 101 reported kidnappings. If the trend continues, Phoenix will record an increase in kidnapping for a fourth straight year.\n\n\n\nMore frustrating is that the numbers represent only a third, maybe less, of the city's kidnappings, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman with 16 years of drug enforcement experience. Most kidnappings aren't reported, he said, because the victims are generally smugglers, drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three.\n\n\n\nOther criminals targeted\n\n\n\nThe most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones. In some cases, a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment, but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom, which can be between $30,000 and $250,000, Thompson said.\n\n\n\n\"[The victims are] wearing the doper bling-bling, and they target them,\" he said. \"We've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $1 million that the person has asked for. In addition to that, they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana, perhaps a pound or two of speed, a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin.\"\n\n\n\nPhoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them, Burgett said.\n\n\n\nLess frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote's patrons, known as pollos (Spanish for chickens), Burgett said.\n\n\n\nBurgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country. See what other cities have a cartel presence\n\n\n\nThere are rarely \"true victims\" in Phoenix's kidnappings, the lieutenant said.\n\n\n\nHowever, one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"uglier than the drug trade\" and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes' bidding when they can't come up with the ransoms.\n\n\n\n\"In the drug business, the people getting killed are in the business. They are not end users, not consumers,\" said Antonio Bustamente. \"In the coyote business, the people killed are really innocent. [First-time] illegal entry is a petty offense.\"\n\n\n\nThough many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix's border-related violence, police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark.\n\n\n\nGirl mistakenly snatched\n\n\n\nOn the evening of March 17, 2008, a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale. They were planning to play basketball. The friend, according to a police investigative report, was the niece of a man named \"Chucky.\"\n\n\n\nChucky and his cohorts, witnesses told police, had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house.\n\n\n\nHours later, the investigative report said, armed men arrived at Chucky's sister's house in three vehicles, one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use.\n\n\n\nThe men wanted Chucky, their drugs or $24,000. The 13-year-old said she didn't know Chucky. When she tried to walk away, \"one of them grabbed her by the neck, pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle,\" the report said.\n\n\n\nEventually, the men called the girl's mother to demand ransom. A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl. She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise.\n\n\n\nThe case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border, collateral damage is a reality.  Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence.\n\n\n\nThe tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him. On Andrade's third day in captivity, an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $50,000 to $10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen.\n\n\n\nWhen the kidnappers arrived at the drop point, a Safeway supermarket parking lot, police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe, the report said. One of the men, Luis Alberto Castro-Vega, then 23, disclosed Andrade's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping.\n\n\n\nOnly Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade's kidnapping: first-degree burglary, theft by extortion, armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault. In September 2006, a judge sentenced Castro-Vega to 54 years in prison.\n\n\n\nThompson said he hopes the stiff sentence sends a message that Phoenix police expect the kidnappings and violence to end, regardless of the targets and the perpetrators.\n\n\n\n\"The problems that occur when it's criminal versus criminal, that's still violence on the streets of America,\" he said. \"If those people get in a gunbattle, those bullets have to go somewhere, and that could be a playground where kids are playing. That could be a neighbor's house where a neighbor is inside sleeping that has nothing to do whatsoever with the illegal activity, but yet they become senseless victims of the violence.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Tom Hanks ", "answer_start": "419"}], "question": "Who stars in \"The Da Vinci Code\"?", "id": "18", "answers": [{"text": "Tom Hanks ", "answer_start": "419"}, {"text": "Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer ", "answer_start": "244"}, {"text": "Ewan McGregor ", "answer_start": "272"}, {"text": "Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer ", "answer_start": "244"}, {"text": "Ewan McGregor ", "answer_start": "272"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points.\n\n\n\nFrom left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier.\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, \"Angels & Demons,\" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,\" Hanks said of the film. \"I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not.\"\n\n\n\nThe movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, \"The Da Vinci Code,\" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore.  Watch Hanks talk aboout the controversy \u00bb\n\n\n\nIt also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed \"Da Vinci,\" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer.\n\n\n\nWhile \"The Da Vinci Code\" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the \"Illuminati.\"\n\n\n\nMcGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \"Star Wars\" films, said that while \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"Angels & Demons\" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own.\n\n\n\n\"If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,\" McGregor said. \"It's a standalone movie ... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not.\"\n\n\n\nBoth films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling.\n\n\n\n\"I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,\" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. \"You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's all a lie,\" Donohue said. \"[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' \"\n\n\n\nTed Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release.\n\n\n\n\"Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,\" Baehr said. \"Faith is often denied throughout the movie.\"\n\n\n\nDirector Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission \"to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,\" a claim Howard emphatically denies.\n\n\n\nThe director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film, but had no success. He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming.\n\n\n\nHanks said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of Rome. At one point, Hanks said, make-believe collided with one woman's fairy tale.\n\n\n\n\"We had a lady showing up who was getting married at the Pantheon and she had to get married and we had to get our shot,\" Hanks said. \"She showed up right between shots, when we were moving cameras.\"\n\n\n\nFortunately, both the wedding and the day's filming were able to be completed, Hanks said.\n\n\n\nMcGregor said Howard was to be credited for how well the production came together. Howard's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors' performances, McGregor said.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of directors are able to tell you what they're after, but Ron's able to tell you what he's after and help you for how you might play that ... which is kind of total directing,\" McGregor said.\n\n\n\nZurer said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film.\n\n\n\nViewers should see the film for what it is, she said, and not focus on the controversy.\n\n\n\n\"It's fun fiction,\" she said. \"It's a fun movie to watch, it's thrilling and that's what I saw in it.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Lisa Respers France contributed to this story."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "three ", "answer_start": "904"}], "question": "How many life-size models are ther?", "id": "826", "answers": [{"text": "three ", "answer_start": "904"}, {"text": "three ", "answer_start": "904"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is a gristmill?", "id": "817c3d35b453fdc41d5ba420ab5d05f534bNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(Southern Living) -- Mount Vernon is undergoing a renaissance.

Now, visitors meet him face-to-face in three life-sized statues, and they can't get enough of America's first action hero.\n\n\n\nAt the museum at Mount Vernon, the 45-year-old future president is depicted riding in Valley Forge.\n\n\n\n\"He's tall!

Today's first President is a well-rounded figure at the expanded visitors center, museum, and education facility at Mount Vernon Estate & Gardens in Virginia.\n\n\n\nA new face for George\n\n\n\nWashington now startles visitors. As they walk through the Donald W. Reynolds Museum and Education Center, one of three life-size models depicts him at age 19, standing 6'2\", with his auburn hair pulled back in a queue. He's lean and lanky like an athlete, with muscular hips and thighs -- the marks of a man comfortable in the saddle. SouthernLiving.com: D.C.

Step around another museum corner and he appears at 45 astride his horse in the snow at Valley Forge. Down another corridor he takes the oath of office at 57.\n\n\n\nMore than mere mannequins, these figures are based on forensic research.

In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a \"newcomer\" who was \"fun to look at,\" but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women,\" Aguilera said in the statement. \"So I would like to tell you all directly so my words cannot be misconstrued to sell someone else's story. ... I have absolutely nothing against Lady Gaga or any other female artist in this business.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Aguilera noted in her statement, this isn't the first time she's \"been unfairly pitted against another female artist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Aguilera or the \"Sex and the City\" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? For that matter, where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting,\" said celebrity blogger Vera Sweeney, who runs IAmNotObsessed.com. \"Even when Shia LaBeouf got into that car accident while on a date with Isabel Lucas -- even though she was dating Adrian Grenier at the time -- nothing happened. Adrian said they weren't serious, and the story was dropped.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, this doesn't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, Eminem and Moby or Nas and Jay-Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, Sweeney said, the \"celebrity men in conflict\" angle will be given a different spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue, different work ethics will most likely be cited,\" she said. \"For example, when Christian Bale and Johnny Depp filmed 'Public Enemy' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they weren't shooting. So it was understood why they weren't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were 'in character.' If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. \"The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,\" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. \"Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and \"The Cult of Celebrity\" author Cooper Lawrence, is because \"it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other. It's one of the few bastions of sexism that's left in our culture, and we can't imagine that powerful, successful women could ever get along.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with, Thompson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are. ... Anyone who's been in a workplace knows that it's not an inherently gender-specific sort of thing,\" Thompson said. But \"with the gender norms that we've all grown up with, men manifest their 'cattiness' differently than women; we're OK with the idea that women are emotional, and we expect them to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut said Ian Drew, senior editor of celebrity magazine Us Weekly, you can't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that's to sell albums and rack up box-office numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, this is a competition,\" Drew said. \"People need to be responsible for their own actions -- [Aguilera] did say those words, and she said those things for a reason. Lady Gaga, for example, never says anything negative about anybody.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf these stars wouldn't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions, Drew said, the media wouldn't start yelling fire. \"No one is a victim in the celebrity world,\" he added. \"Very few of those rumors end up not being true.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether they're true or not, Sweeney said she's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one aren't likely to let up anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The question isn't why are these stories about women catfights being created,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the question is why not?

For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.\"\n\n\n\nThe new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces.\n\n\n\nObama, whom Republicans had accused of \"dithering\" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said.\n\n\n\nThe push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly.\n\n\n\nA Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is \"trying to do it faster\" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nMcChrystal wrote in a report in August that a \"failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible.\"\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is \"very aggressive\" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order.\n\n\n\nOpponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner.\n\n\n\nObama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement.\n\n\n\n\"The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nShare your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision\n\n\n\nThe decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nHis liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation.\n\n\n\nU.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught.\n\n\n\nTaliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region.\n\n\n\nThe conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Brazilian supreme ", "answer_start": "34"}], "question": "Who suspended the lower courts order?", "id": "2316", "answers": [{"text": "Brazilian supreme ", "answer_start": "34"}, {"text": "judge ", "answer_start": "58"}, {"text": "Brazilian supreme ", "answer_start": "34"}, {"text": "judge ", "answer_start": "58"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A Brazilian supreme court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court's order that would have given custody of a 9-year-old boy to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, where he was to be reunited with his American father.\n\n\n\nDavid Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son, Sean, since the boy's mother took him to Brazil in 2004.\n\n\n\nJudge Marco Aurelio argued against taking Sean Richard Goldman from what has been his home for almost five years to the United States \"in an abrupt manner.\"\n\n\n\nDoing so, he wrote in his order published on the court's Web site, could subject the boy to psychological harm.\n\n\n\nThe decision, which means the entire Brazilian supreme court will take up the case, comes a day after a superior court justice ordered Sean taken Wednesday to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father, David Goldman, who arrived Tuesday from New Jersey to pick up his son.\n\n\n\nThe two were separated in June 2004 when the boy's Brazilian mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, told Goldman -- to whom she was then married -- that she was taking the boy on a two-week vacation to Brazil.

World-renowned security expert Gavin de Becker says this weapon exists, but you already have it. He calls it \"the gift of fear.\"\n\n\n\nOne chapter in Gavin's book \"The Gift of Fear\" has stuck with Oprah since she first read it.\n\n\n\nThe story of a woman named Kelly begins with a simple warning sign. A man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly, Kelly doesn't like the sound of his voice. Kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so, she lets a rapist into her home.\n\n\n\n\"We get a signal prior to violence,\" Gavin says. \"There are preincident indicators. Things that happen before violence occurs.\"\n\n\n\nGavin says that unlike any other living creature, humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it.\n\n\n\n\"You're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night. Elevator door opens, and there's a guy inside, and he makes you afraid. You don't know why, you don't know what it is. Some memory of this building -- whatever it may be. And many women will stand there and look at that guy and say, 'Oh, I don't want to think like that. I don't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face. I've got to be nice. I don't want him to think I'm not nice.' And so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they're afraid of, and there's not another animal in nature that would even consider it.\"\n\n\n\nFor weeks, Nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment. \"My gut started feeling like something just wasn't right,\" she says. \"I would come home, and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that I didn't even remember turning on in the first place.\"\n\n\n\nThen one day, Nicole noticed a UPS delivery box where it shouldn't be. \"I'm like, 'How did this brand of box get on my back balcony?'\" Nicole began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off. \"I would just come home, you know, and almost feel nauseous,\" she says. \"I kept trying to justify it saying, 'Okay, it is in my head.'\"\n\n\n\nNicole's funny feeling eventually escalated into full-fledged panic attacks, which Gavin says were her intuition's way of telling her that something was wrong.\n\n\n\n\"And intuition records everything. So when she started getting panics attacks, her intuition is saying, basically, 'You're not going to listen? Okay, I'll ramp it up. I'll give you panic attacks. You want sleepless nights? I'll give you sleepless nights.'\"\n\n\n\nNicole eventually did listen to her intuition, starting with a simple test. \"I dropped a tank top behind the door as I was leaving for work, thinking that when I come home that night, I'm going to peek my head around the corner. If [the tank top] had been pushed to the side, it would have been obvious that the door was opened.\" When Nicole got home, she says the tank top had moved.\n\n\n\nCaught on camera\n\n\n\nThe next day, Nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment. Once she came home, Nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop. \"And the first thing I see is this man's head peeking around the corner into my house,\" she says. \"What I felt at that point was just complete terror. I'm sitting there watching this video --this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house, is looking around, going through my things, looking through my laundry, holding up my lingerie.\"\n\n\n\nAs Nicole continues to watch in horror, the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on. \"So this person is in my clothes, proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very, very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings. And he finishes up, takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as I had left them -- puts his clothes back on, checks to make sure nobody's outside the door and leaves.\"\n\n\n\nAfter watching the tape, Nicole says she ran around her apartment, screaming hysterically. She says she had never seen the man in the tape before. \"Initially, I took my cell phone, called my boyfriend at the time, screaming hysterically. All I could say was, 'He's in my house. He's in my house.' Even picking up the phone, dialing, was difficult.\"\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, police found the man -- 39-year-old Shawn Rogers, a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time. Police were unable to charge Rogers with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to Nicole's apartment to steal her camera. Police were able to charge Rogers with burglary, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\n\n\nDangerous behavior\n\n\n\nWhen Nicole found the UPS box on her balcony, Gavin says this was a warning sign. Gavin applauds Nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate. \"He's already into behavior of wanting to get caught,\" he says. \"You don't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught.\"\n\n\n\nGavin says like Nicole, the intruder's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too. \"Offenders as well can see what's happening in their lives. And talk about not listening to it -- he's in someone's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that's something to listen to.\"\n\n\n\nBecause the intruder had a job and a family, Gavin says his behavior was not only reckless, but dangerous as well.\n\n\n\n\"When people do listen, they can stop what's almost fate,\" Gavin says. \"There's a great line that Carl Jung said. He said, 'What we do not make conscious emerges later as fate.' If he made it conscious, if he could talk to someone about it, if he could tell someone, he could get better also. But he didn't, and it does mean escalation. If she discovered him, that's dangerous. If he came in when she was there, that's dangerous.\"\n\n\n\nYour feelings are warnings\n\n\n\nDoris, who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, appeared on \"The Oprah Show\" after leaving her husband. Unfortunately, her battle didn't end there -- two months after she left him, Doris's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her.\n\n\n\nAfter the show, Oprah spoke with Doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted. \"As I was coming home from work, it was just a very eerie, strange feeling as I drove up,\" Doris says. \"It was darker than normal in my driveway, and there was a trash can sitting where I normally park right in the middle.\n\n\n\n\"I thought, 'Hmm, this is strange.' Because my mother lives with me, and she'll turn on the lights when it gets dark. It did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up. But still, I didn't listen to my instincts.\"\n\n\n\nGavin says that \"eerie feeling\" is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to. \"We're trying to analyze the warning signs,\" he says. \"And what I really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign. All the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling. Why it was this, why it was that. The feeling itself is the warning sign.\"\n\n\n\nFrom \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\"\n\n\n\nSubscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price. That's like getting 18 issues FREE.

He was there to talk about getting laptop computers into the hands of little girls.\n\n\n\nGirls in India take a seat on the floor and get to work on their new laptops.\n\n\n\nAs Taliban insurgents continue to crack down on girls who go to school and women who dare to teach them, Keller was awestruck by the Afghan government's determination to educate all children, even if it means finding tools that allow them to intellectually grow in the privacy of their own homes.\n\n\n\n\"For them to propose this was astounding,\" said Keller, who works for One Laptop per Child, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, nonprofit committed to creating and distributing affordable, durable and solar-powered laptops to the world's poorest children. \"That hunger for knowledge, that desire to learn, is pretty profound.\"\n\n\n\nFrom Uruguay, Haiti and Mexico to Mongolia, Ghana and the small Polynesian island of Niue, at least 750,000 kids -- a number that will double by June, Chairman Nicholas Negroponte said -- are tapping away on One Laptop per Child-produced XO laptop keyboards.\n\n\n\nThey're exploring mathematics, composing music and art, learning new languages, designing animation, collecting data, collaborating with peers across borders and accessing learning tools (including textbooks) that they would never see otherwise.\n\n\n\nTargeting current and historic conflict zones, including Iraq, Rwanda and most recently the Gaza Strip, not only fulfills the group's mission to offer equal-access education to the most isolated children, it may also promote world peace, Keller said.\n\n\n\nBy putting laptops \"into the hands of kids who would otherwise be indoctrinated,\" he explained, \"we can make the case pretty successfully that doing this is a long-term solution to root causes.\"\n\n\n\nWhen the laptops, which incorporate free wireless Internet connectivity and open-source programming, first rolled out in 2007, they cost $205 each. Now, they're down to $180.\n\n\n\nThe price is higher than Negroponte's original goal of $100 a pop, but it's a figure he believes will keep going down as One Laptop per Child finds ways to engineer the product with fewer components.\n\n\n\nThe hope is that with corporate sponsorships and donations, collected through a program called Give One Get One, the computers can be delivered to kids at no cost to the poorest host-country governments.\n\n\n\nThe laptops allow students to engage in learning differently, enjoy a customized approach and hone critical thinking skills, explained David Cavallo, One Laptop per Child's vice president of learning. And their mere existence, he said, keeps kids coming to school.\n\n\n\nCavallo spoke of a school in Rwanda that lacks electricity and traditionally had a 50 percent attendance rate. It is now drawing 1,000 more students than its previous full capacity, he said, and is even attracting kids -- who in turn are teaching their parents and grandparents -- on weekends.\n\n\n\n\"Rwanda is recovering from genocide,\" he said. This is a \"real engagement of a society directing itself to a different future.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the kids, no matter their previous exposure to technology, immediately gravitate to the machines. Keller, the group's director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recalled a visit to rural Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs he passed out the laptops, he kept one eye on the children, the other on his watch. Seven seconds was all it took for an 8-year-old boy to flip open the never-seen-before computer, find and then hit the power button.\n\n\n\nWithin two weeks, that boy and his classmates would be programming. Meanwhile, the nearby adults stared at the oddball objects and flashed the international look of, \"What the hell is this thing?\" Keller said. \"Kids are technology natives, and adults are technology immigrants.\"\n\n\n\nDespite its ongoing successes, the downturn in the economy has taken a toll on the nonprofit. The last Give One Get One promotion brought in $2.5 million, while the first incarnation brought in $37.5 million, Negroponte said. And corporate sponsors fell from 11 to three in the span of 30 days, he added. Early this year, the organization laid off half of its staff, bringing the total on payroll to just 32.\n\n\n\nThese economic realities, though disappointing, won't impede the mission, said Negroponte, who created One Laptop per Child with others from the MIT Media Lab. Thousands of volunteers around the world offer technical support and training, and serve as translators and programmers.\n\n\n\n\"If we could get all the children in the world -- 1.2 billion of them between 6 and 12 -- to have a connected laptop, that would be success,\" Negroponte said. \"Roughly half of those children have no electricity at home or school. The poverty is so extreme, and the environmental conditions are so extreme, we have to focus on them.\"\n\n\n\nThe push has been to reach out to developing nations, but that hasn't precluded the group from serving American communities that can pursue the program at a scale that makes sense financially.\n\n\n\nBirmingham City Schools in Alabama, for example, now has 14,000 of the group's laptops in students' hands.\n\n\n\nMichael Wilson, principal of Glen Iris Elementary School in Birmingham, opened his building's doors last year as the district's pilot school for the free laptop program.\n\n\n\n\"It's been an overwhelming success at our school,\" which has a poverty rate of 83 percent, Wilson said. Through professional development and a summer camp for kids, the school is learning how to best utilize the computers. And the students, who own their laptops, are learning about responsibility.\n\n\n\nThey're \"totally engaged in what they're doing,\" Wilson said. \"I have kids getting out of cars in the morning with their laptops open.\"\n\n\n\nOne of those kids might be Amicah Bitten, a fourth-grader who is using the computer on her own time to learn Spanish with her mother, Kamonia Bates.\n\n\n\n\"It gets me more interested because she's interested. ...

If a majority signed, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate union representation.\n\n\n\nIt would also stiffen federal laws barring employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.\n\n\n\nThe traditional option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the \"card check\" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join.\n\n\n\nSome corporate leaders have reacted angrily against the measure.\n\n\n\nIf a retailer has not gotten involved with fight over this bill, he \"should be shot,\" Bernie Marcus, co-founder and former CEO of The Home Depot, said during a conference call about the act last October. Retailers who don't speak out against it \"should be thrown out of their goddamn jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is how a civilization disappears,\" Marcus said. \"I'm sitting here as an elder statesman, and I'm watching this happen, and I don't believe it.\"\n\n\n\nDave Bego, a business owner in Indianapolis, Indiana, shares Marcus' concern.\n\n\n\nBego is the owner of EMS, which provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire from the SEIU, which argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years.\n\n\n\nBego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.\n\n\n\nHe said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and even released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. But he told CNN his workers don't want a union because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues.\n\n\n\n\"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],\" Bego said. \"They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so.\"\n\n\n\nBut union workers CNN talked to say workers at EMS are afraid to speak out because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was.\n\n\n\n\"We're not the only ones,\" Brown said. \"There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same\" kinds of things.\n\n\n\nAnd that, says Stern, is why the Free Choice Act is so critical. The SEIU president claims the legislation merely provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union.\n\n\n\n\"This is workers' choice,\" Stern said in February. \"They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards.\"\n\n\n\nObservers believe Stern's union has the muscle to push the legislation through the Democratically controlled Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives. The union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election.\n\n\n\nNow \"we have a friend in the White House,\" Stern declared Monday. \"Thank God for Barack Obama.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Drew Griffin, Marcus Hooper and Kathleen Johnston contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "ACAS-moderated ", "answer_start": "4696"}], "question": "What deal has been agreed?", "id": "587", "answers": [{"text": "ACAS-moderated ", "answer_start": "4696"}, {"text": "being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts ", "answer_start": "855"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2, \"855:926\": 1}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "To whom are the new offered to?", "id": "730e00fa344c718400ba9a98ecbdf8407cbNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters at the Lindsay Oil Refinery are opposed to plans to employ non-British workers at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers walked off the job January 28 to protest the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers for a construction project at the Lindsey oil refinery in eastern England.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir action has prompted similar \"wildcat\" strikes, unsanctioned by national unions, at other sites across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compromise will involve opening 101 new jobs to British workers, the arbitration service ACAS said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal union leaders had earlier told demonstrators they were near their goal of being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts connected to the construction project -- 102 new jobs for a minimum of nine weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you can't be happy with that, you can't be happy with anything,\" a local union official said at a demonstration televised by Britain's Sky News.

Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\"\n\nAnd ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs \u00bb\n\nIn the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.\n\nWhat's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase.\n\n\"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer.\n\n\"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\"\n\nHowever, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy.\n\n\"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren.\n\n\"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\"\n\nWell, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers.\n\nLauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career.\n\nBut far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global.\n\n\"Americans have a real inferiority about their own style. We've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go.\"\n\nAlready in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan ... oh, everywhere. \"There aren't enough Americans out there,\" he says.

A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information.\n\n\n\nRoland S. Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication.\n\n\n\nShe's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin.\n\n\n\nBut when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt.\n\n\n\nApparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor.\n\n\n\nAccording to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up.\n\n\n\n\"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter.\n\n\n\n\"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\"\n\n\n\nThe actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years.\n\n\n\nShe was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit.\n\n\n\nSo she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nReligious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine.\n\n\n\nAnyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation.\n\n\n\nI've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr., preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban. Second, there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God.\n\n\n\nThat is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time (and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore the biblical story of Deborah, who was a judge in the Old Testament -- and was over men).\n\n\n\nBut what is a greater issue is that Lifeway clearly has no respect for freedom of the press. Here is arguably the top Christian bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine. A spokesman for Lifeway Resources, which runs the stores, was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week as saying of female pastors, \"It is contrary to what we believe.\"\n\n\n\nSo does Lifeway and, by extension, the Southern Baptist Convention, fight vigorously for freedom of religion, but it doesn't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution?\n\n\n\nI now wonder whether Lifeway makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves.\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion. I suppose it's fitting that this story would come out the same time as Bill Maher releases his religious documentary, \"Religulous,\" which skewers all the major religions for their dogma.

I cannot hold it anymore if you keep bothering me.''\n\n\n\nNow she is in Japan with the children. Christopher Savoie sits in a Japanese jail accused of trying to kidnap them.\n\n\n\nHe practically predicted it would end this way.\n\n\n\nThe couple, citizens of the United States and Japan, were married for 14 years and lived in Japan. But they came to the United States with 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca. They divorced in January 2009 after Christopher Savoie was unfaithful. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States.\n\n\n\nDuring the divorce, Christopher Savoie was concerned that his ex-wife would move to Japan with the children. After receiving the threatening e-mail, he went to court to try to prevent that.\n\n\n\nHe pleaded with a judge in March to stop Noriko Savoie from being able to travel to Japan for summer vacation.\n\n\n\nHe knew if she took the children to Japan to live the deck would be stacked against him. Japanese law would recognize Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian and he might never see his children again.\n\n\n\nNoriko Savoie told a judge the words in her e-mail were in the heat of the moment; she was angry that her ex-husband had just married the woman who caused their marriage to end.\n\n\n\n\"I was very, very -- at the peak of my frustration ...\" Noriko Savoie told a judge, according to court transcripts. \"He actually married three days before that e-mail. He remarried the person -- a woman whom he was having affair [with], so I was very depressed and -- but also angry.\"\n\n\n\nNoriko Savoie was asked repeatedly in court if she would try to take the children and flee to Japan. Her answer was always no.\n\n\n\n\"I have never thought about taking children away from their father, never,\" she told the judge.\n\n\n\nChristopher Savoie didn't believe her.\n\n\n\nTheir divorce had been rocky, both of them said. The court documents reveal bitter fights and mediations during the divorce. The two accused each other of sending harassing e-mails. They also fought over sending the kids to baseball, Scouts and other activities. Noriko Savoie accused him of not giving her enough money to take English language lessons or go to school so she could get a job. He accused her of not trying hard enough to enroll or find a place to live.  Dad paid ex-wife $800K in divorce \u00bb\n\n\n\nDespite those issues, Christopher Savoie said his only concern was making sure he wouldn't be separated from his children.\n\n\n\nHe knew trying to get the kids back would be \"a futile effort\" if Noriko Savoie did flee with the children, according to court documents.\n\n\n\nHe laid out in court a scenario similar to what he is facing.\n\n\n\n\"If she were to go to Japan with the children and with primary custodial rights, there's pretty much no doubt that I would have a very difficult time enforcing my rights to visitation should Noriko decide not to let the children see me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe said he'd have a hard time paying expensive legal fees because most of his money was tied up in his house, car and 401(k) after he gave Noriko Savoie more than $700,000 as part of the divorce settlement. With that money, he feared she'd be able to move and hide the children from him.\n\n\n\nWhen appointed parental coordinators asked her if she planned to take the children to Japan, she hesitated and simply answered \"I think the kids will be happy if I'm happy.\" The judge asked Noriko Savoie rhetorically whether she would be willing to put up money, essentially a bond, to ensure she'd return from Japan. She agreed, but was never asked to do so.\n\n\n\nJudge James G. Martin III warned Noriko Savoie she would lose her alimony, education funds and other money if she fled with the children, before ruling that he believed she wouldn't abscond with them and allowed her to travel to Japan.\n\n\n\nNoriko Savoie followed the court's rules and took the children on vacation and returned during the required time to the United States. But days later, she took the children back to Japan.\n\n\n\nThe court in the United States granted Christopher Savoie full custody after Noriko Savoie fled the country. But that court order means nothing in Japan, where courts generally favor mothers in custody disputes.\n\n\n\nThe couple is also still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, Japanese police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.\n\n\n\nA 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement.\n\n\n\nChristopher Savoie knew all this when he decided this week to go to Japan to get his children back.\n\n\n\nHe took the children as Noriko Savoie walked them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan. He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka on the Southern island of Kyushu, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested.\n\n\n\nChristopher Savoie, who will be in jail for the next 10 days while Japanese officials sort out the situation, told CNN's Kyung Lah that he was scared and just wanted to see his children.\n\n\n\n\"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,\" he said. \"Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you.\"\n\n\n\nThough he had warned everyone this was going to happen, this time he could speak in certainties.\n\n\n\nHe said that though he knows it might be a tough battle, it's one he will continue to vocalize.\n\n\n\n\"I want Americans to know what's happening to me,\" Christopher Savoie said in Japanese. \"I didn't do anything wrong.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Swim ", "answer_start": "70"}], "question": "What is the club about?", "id": "216", "answers": [{"text": "Swim ", "answer_start": "70"}, {"text": "invited camps in the Philadelphia area to use his facility because of the number of pools in the region ", "answer_start": "527"}, {"text": "Swim ", "answer_start": "70"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "who has to decide what to do?", "id": "503af882578ab9140aba1ed6d1bbf44c9ebNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- The president of The Valley Swim Club on Friday strongly denied charges of racism after his club canceled the swimming privileges of a nearby day care center whose children are predominantly African-American.\n\n\n\nJohn Duesler said he underestimated the number of swimmers who would come to swim at the club.\n\n\n\n\"It was never our intention to offend anyone,\" said John Duesler. \"This thing has been blown out of proportion.\"\n\n\n\nDuesler said his club -- which he called \"very diverse\" -- invited camps in the Philadelphia area to use his facility because of the number of pools in the region closed due to budget cuts this summer.

But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later.\n\n\n\nThe 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70.\n\n\n\nA roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available.\n\n\n\nTrain riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide.\n\n\n\n\"The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,\" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. \"And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park.\"\n\n\n\nKraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars.\n\n\n\n\"I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. \"We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988.\n\n\n\nKraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures.\n\n\n\nThere is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident.\n\n\n\nOne time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain.\n\n\n\nThey called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nIt was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms.

He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress.\n\n\n\nThe governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia.\n\n\n\nLa Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said.

If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.\n\n\n\nObama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week.\n\n\n\nGibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil.

Three Guantanamo detainees' cases have gone through the commission so far.\n\n\n\nThe Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001. The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system.\n\n\n\nBut legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated.\n\n\n\nOne lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility, which Obama is advocating, is a \"meaningless gesture\" if the military commissions continue.\n\n\n\n\"The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed,\" said Army Maj.

Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said.\n\n\n\nDuring Thursday's debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible.\n\n\n\nHe also accused the Israeli government of \"ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians.\"\n\n\n\nBut Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a \"deeply nasty organization.\"\n\n\n\nBill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's \"whole ethos is one of violence\" and that it had \"made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,\" Rammell said. \"In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens.

Bobby Jindal in a prime-time exclusive interview Monday night.\n\nLousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"\n\nJindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.\n\nI hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.\n\nWhat's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nLet's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.\n\nKing: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?\n\nJindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.\n\nLess than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ...\n\nFundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.\n\nKing: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.\n\nJindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ...\n\nI think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.\n\nKing: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?\n\nJindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.\n\nLet me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first.\n\nBut when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American. I just don't think it should be a government-run program.\n\nKing: All right, governor, here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend's CPAC Conference. Watch.\n\nRush Limbaugh: What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?\n\nKing: Governor, do you think people are thinking about capitalism now or are they thinking about problems?\n\nJindal: Look, clearly, the American people are worried about paying their mortgages, keeping their jobs and paying their health care bills. I think Rush is a great leader for conservatives. I think he articulates what a lot of people are concerned about.\n\nKing: Do you want him [Obama] to fail?\n\nJindal: I don't want those policies to be adopted. I want my country to succeed, but I don't want policies to be adopted.\n\nKing: What if the policies work?\n\nJindal: Well, again...\n\nKing: What if they work?\n\nJindal: This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I don't think it's going work ... to spend in excess of our revenues.\n\nI want my country to succeed. But what I worry about is that simply spending money on new programs. Look at every new bailout. You talked about the auto bailouts. Then you had the fourth, I think it's the fourth -- it's hard to keep track -- AIG bailout today. It seems like every time you turn around, there's another trillion dollar plan.\n\nKing: One more thing. It may be moot now, but RNC Chairman Michael Steele took some shots at Limbaugh and then apologized. What do you make of all of that?\n\nJindal: Well, I didn't follow the day's events. I'm glad he apologized. I think the chairman is a breath of fresh air for the party. As I said before, I think Rush is a leader for many conservatives and says things that people are concerned about. [He] articulates very well the concern people have about growing government spending without an end in sight.\n\nKing: Thanks, governor. We'll call on you again. Always good seeing you.\n\nJindal: Thank you, Larry."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "All three pleaded not ", "answer_start": "3575"}], "question": "Have the teens charged pled guilty?", "id": "844", "answers": [{"text": "Jarvis' older brother has been ", "answer_start": "797"}, {"text": "All three pleaded not ", "answer_start": "3575"}, {"text": "has been ", "answer_start": "819"}], "validated_answers": "{\"3575:3597\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is the outcome of the trial?", "id": "586c14521cee8214a958b475e91ed5e2817NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Which teen uses it?", "id": "7000aff7392364049258480aedb3ab3420eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.\n\n\n\n\"It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,\" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBrewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement:\n\n\n\n\"I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,\" Jeremy Jarvis said. \"I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery.\"\n\n\n\nJarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she \"can't focus on that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHer son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman.\n\n\n\nThe teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.\n\n\n\n\"Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,\" Schulman said. \"He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event.\"\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is \"incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed.\"\n\n\n\nThe boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where \"they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nHeavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. \"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nPolice were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that \"he answered the questions they asked.\"\n\n\n\nThe interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County.\n\n\n\n\"It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,\" she said of the interview. \"Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation.\"\n\n\n\nDenver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.\n\n\n\nDetectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a \"bad decision.\"\n\n\n\nJeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case.\n\n\n\nHe has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. \"He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appears the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest and he is currently being home-schooled, Melnick said. He described his client was a good friend of Brewer, and said the boy is troubled by Brewer's injuries as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted.\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer said it was \"heartbreaking\" when she and her husband learned that her son's attackers may have included kids that they knew.\n\n\n\n\"But we don't focus on that,\" she added. \"We focus strictly on Michael and his recovery. We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period. We don't watch the news because we're living this nightmare and we don't need to see it on the TV. So we just stay away from it and stay positive for Michael.\"\n\n\n\nHer son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said.\n\n\n\n\"It's been a roller coaster ride, the fear of the unknown,\" she said. \"The first time he spoke to us was joyous but watching him struggle every single day ...\n\n\n\n\"I'm proud of him, I'm very, very proud of him, 'cause I don't think I could do what he's doing.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Athens, ", "answer_start": "877"}], "question": "Where was the teenage boy shot?", "id": "12", "answers": [{"text": "Athens, ", "answer_start": "877"}, {"text": "Athens, ", "answer_start": "877"}, {"text": "Athens, ", "answer_start": "877"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "The government says what is underway?", "id": "64d0b992d640974a7a9e2204bbbf1b1661NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- Authorities vowed to re-impose order after demonstrators rose up across Greece Monday in a third day of rioting over Saturday's killing of a 15-year-old boy that has left dozens injured and scores of properties destroyed.\n\nAn undated photo of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, whose death has sparked riots across Greece.\n\n\"Under no circumstances will the government accept what is occurring,\" said Greek Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos. \"We will do what is necessary.\"\n\nIt was unclear what would be necessary to placate the demonstrators. \"We've just lost count of how many demonstrations are taking place now,\" a police spokesman in Athens told CNN.\n\nPolice said 34 civilians and 16 police officers were injured Monday in rioting that spread into new municipalities, including Trikala, Larissam and Veria.\n\nRiots broke out Saturday in Thessaloniki and Athens, where police killed the teen.

Will you be able to continue that?\n\n\n\nMark Fields: Well, our position hasn't changed. We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance.\n\n\n\nChetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace. And we've been working this plan over the last three years, and we've been making progress.\n\n\n\nClearly it's a tough time in the economy, but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers, getting our cost structure right. We've come to new agreements with our UAW partners. We're working through reducing our debt. So we're going to continue working through that, and we don't expect to take taxpayer assistance from the emergency funds.  Watch Fields discuss Ford's future \u00bb\n\n\n\nChetry: You say it's been tough times, and certainly for you guys, it has -- 2008 the worst annual loss in Ford's 105-year history. You guys can restructure. You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again.\n\n\n\nBut getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind.\n\n\n\nPost your comments on AMfix\n\n\n\nChetry: You're also offering some zero percent financing. I'm sure that you're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances. I want to get your take on this, though.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama announced yesterday he's giving ... Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out. Was that the right move, in your opinion?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry. As we mentioned, Ford is in a different position. We're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance. But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business, but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we're going -- we're coming out with over the next couple of months.\n\n\n\nChetry: You know, there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors. They're getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money. They're being forced to restructure, as we talked about. They actually were forced to fire their CEO. And right now, it seems that, you know, they're on a different level than you guys are. Is there some sense that perhaps there's an unfair advantage, that they're getting a lot of government help, whereas you guys are sort of on your own. Does that concern you?\n\n\n\nFields: Well, we don't feel we're being disadvantaged, because we have been restructuring our company over the past three years. We have been investing in high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles over the last couple of years, which are just starting to come to the marketplace. So our approach is continue to work this plan, continue to make sure that Ford remains competitive both today and in the future and continue to work with our stakeholders to make sure that happens."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "three different videos ", "answer_start": "1152"}], "question": "What will be nominated?", "id": "1940", "answers": [{"text": "three different videos ", "answer_start": "1152"}], "validated_answers": "{\"1152:1175\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What should you do with your own videos?", "id": "015a18241f7684d5686de73b4a821099aNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What will you rate?", "id": "504f338ca1f9a094540865a55a075c7a68eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- What could be more powerful than the tears of a Native American Indian?\n\n\n\nWax on, wax off: Does it make you want to save the rainforests?\n\n\n\nIron Eyes Cody was the face of the Keep American Beautiful campaign of 1971 whose tears marked the plight of the environment, but more importantly kept the problems of pollution in the minds of millions.\n\n\n\nFrom teary Native Americans to witty skits or doom-ladened eco-horror scenarios, the environmental campaign video then has long been a powerful tool for environmental groups to spread their message and raise pubic attention.\n\n\n\nThe rise of YouTube and other video sharing web sites has now meant that individuals can broadcast their own eco-awareness messages and form their own social action networks.\n\n\n\nBut what makes a good video and how much impact do they have?

Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. \"I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district.\"\n\n\n\nBut they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, \"I have to get out.\"\n\n\n\nBrown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction.\n\n\n\nThe bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. \"I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nWatch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move \u00bb  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't see there was a problem,\" she said. \"You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem.\"\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark.\n\n\n\nNew York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. \"In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,\" he says.\n\n\n\nKlein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go.\n\n\n\nSimilar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. \"What we're facing here\", Klein says, \"is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it.\"\n\n\n\nBrown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. \"She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it. Nothing, except take my money.\"\n\n\n\nBrown was paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. She says that money is gone. \"She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing.\"\n\n\n\nCNN tried to reach the owner, who lives upstairs, for comment, but her phone was disconnected, and no one answered the door. The broker who rented her the house and who was paid $1,900 says he did not know the house was in foreclosure. He also says the brokerage fee will not be returned.\n\n\n\n\"It took everything I had to move in,\" Brown says, \"to give my kids a better environment.\" And now, \"I'm left out with nothing.\"\n\n\n\nBecause eviction papers trump the lease, Brown has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go.\n\n\n\n\"If it was me, yeah I could move out and go on my own. But it's my family you're talking about, my children, my three daughters and my pets, that I brought in here thinking that we were going to stay and be happy.\"\n\n\n\nBrown is considering suing the owner in small-claims court to get her money back and cover moving expenses. For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "for Disease Control and Prevention, ", "answer_start": "455"}], "question": "Where is the Emergency Operations Center located?", "id": "92", "answers": [{"text": "for Disease Control and Prevention, ", "answer_start": "455"}, {"text": "CDC..\n", "answer_start": "260"}, {"text": "ATLANTA, Georgia ", "answer_start": "0"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what does it operate", "id": "1057b74c3541534495faaa346d3e609d0d3NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In a bustling room full of computers, giant wall-mounted monitors and constantly ringing telephones, a newly gathered army is fighting a war.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe swine flu outbreak has kept workers busy at the Emergency Operations Center at the CDC..\n\n\n\n\n\nThe control room is staffed 24/7, and the leader recently had to tell his fighters to make sure to take a day off per week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Emergency Operations Center at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has ramped up its resources to tackle swine flu, a new disease that experts say may evolve into a global pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The last time when we were really at this level was Hurricane Katrina,\" said Toby Crafton, operations manager.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC has 400 people tasked to work on the virus, also called the 2009 H1N1 flu, Crafton said.

The people -- some in jeans, some in skirts, some in uniforms with military stripes -- are fielding phones calls to their respective departments.\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in laboratories, samples of the virus arrive in FedEx and World Courier packages for analysis, triple packaged to avoid leaking. Scientists are working on the genetic sequencing of the virus, as well as growing a strain that functions as a vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the CDC is not in the business of mass-producing vaccines, researchers there are working on developing one. A vaccine strain is being grown and characterized, Schuchat said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a suitable candidate virus is developed -- it takes about three weeks -- the CDC theoretically would send it to a manufacturer, which would need another eight to 10 weeks to determine production possibilities as well as the dosage, said Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the CDC's Influenza Division, at a press conference Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it would not interfere with the seasonal influenza vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If a vaccine for this new virus is prepared, it would be prepared either in parallel with or after the seasonal vaccine is already produced,\" Cox said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there has not been a recommendation to mass produce a vaccine for swine flu. The U.S. part of that decision would come from the Department of Health and Human Services.  Map: Where the flu is \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are still struggling to understand the origin of the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What isn't making sense right now is why there weren't reports of illness in pigs,\" said Michael Shaw, leader of the laboratory team force for the 2009 H1N1 virus. \"Usually, if you find a human who has been infected by a swine influenza virus, you look around, you start seeing sick pigs, and we haven't seen that.\"  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with Michael Shaw about what CDC is doing to combat virus \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible that the virus did not originate in pigs. Swine viruses have been found in turkeys, for example, Shaw said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 virus has a \"level 2\" containment distinction at the CDC, although extra precautions from \"level 3\" are being applied, Shaw said. That means swine flu is one containment level below avian flu, which was at 3. One key handling difference is that lab workers had to shower after being exposed to the avian virus, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in the Emergency Operations Center, computer screens glow with e-mails, maps, databases, slides and articles related to the new flu strain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to continue to be vigilant and continue to work as hard as we can until it's over,\" Crafton said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"peregruzka\" ", "answer_start": "552"}], "question": "What did the \"reset\" button actually say?", "id": "450", "answers": [{"text": "\"peregruzka\" ", "answer_start": "552"}, {"text": "'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'\"\n", "answer_start": "1060"}, {"text": "(the Russian word for reset,) Lavrov said. \"This ", "answer_start": "1006"}, {"text": "'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'\"\n", "answer_start": "1060"}, {"text": "\"It should be \"perezagruzka\" ", "answer_start": "977"}], "validated_answers": "{\"552:565\": 2}"}], "context": "GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN)  -- The Obama administration has been talking about \"pressing the reset button\" with Russia after relations \"crashed\" when Russia invaded Georgia last August.\n\n\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their \"reset' button.\n\n\n\nWhen Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon.

The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver.\n\n\n\n\"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,\" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe patient had previously \"suffered severe facial trauma,\" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nThe surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nSocial reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the \"common world,\" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said.\n\n\n\nThe patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the \"things we take for granted every day,\" Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nThe patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves.\n\n\n\nAs for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. \"At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSiemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.\n\n\n\nOnly patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nCurrently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.\n\n\n\nWhile burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nPreviously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.\n\n\n\nOne of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.\n\n\n\nEuropean news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.\n\n\n\nResearchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say. They are identifying genes that become mutated and cause the skull and facial features to become distorted.\n\n\n\n\"We're moving into the arena where we can do medical treatment,\" Dr. Ethylin Jabs, professor of developmental and regenerative biology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said at the conference.\n\n\n\nOne example is Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition found in one in every 50,000 births, which affects the development of bones and other tissues in the face. Scientists have determined that the gene TCOF1 is involved in the disorder, and research is ongoing into the precise function of this protein.\n\n\n\nBy looking at the genetic underpinnings of disorders that lead to facial deformities, scientists can also understand what accounts for the normal differences in face and skull types.\n\n\n\n\"These are going to be some of the genes that cause some of that variation,\" Jabs said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Picasso's muse and mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.\n", "answer_start": "1254"}], "question": "What does the painting show?", "id": "135", "answers": [{"text": "Picasso's muse and mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.\n", "answer_start": "1254"}, {"text": "Marie-Therese Walter.\n", "answer_start": "1283"}, {"text": "Picasso's muse and mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.\n", "answer_start": "1254"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "ting shows Picasso's muse and mistress", "id": "398025ac93109c34ca2bffcc0697f9a267dNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Bust\" sells for $106,482,500, the mos", "id": "582f8458a61ec574a6189fcdf8cc5fd10f5NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "s $104 million for Alberto Giacometti's \"L'", "id": "75500205df9f52f4a0bab3f7360f8e2ff06NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "New York (CNN) -- A Picasso painting fetched nearly $106.5 million at auction Tuesday, a record for any single work of art, Christie's New York said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust\" sold for $106,482,500 to an unidentified telephone bidder, the auction house said in a news release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Silence fell over the packed saleroom as Christopher Burge conducted nine minutes of bidding that involved eight clients,\" it said. \"Christie's lead auctioneer took bids from a client in the saleroom as well as those on the phone before the competition settled down to two bidders at the $88 million mark and a one-on-one battle ensued.

The 31-year-old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of \"an eye for an eye,\" and, in accordance with Islamic law, she wants to blind Majid Movahedi, the man who blinded her.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to blind him for revenge,\" Bahrami said in her parents' Tehran apartment. \"I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else.\"\n\n\n\nBahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university.\n\n\n\nShe was a 24-year-old electronics student.

He wouldn't stay silent for long.\n\n\n\nBahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. \"He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' \"\n\n\n\nOn a November afternoon in 2004, Movahedi's threats turned to violence.\n\n\n\nThat day at 4:30 p.m., Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her.\n\n\n\nShe turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin.\n\n\n\n\"I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' \"\n\n\n\nThe acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes \u00bb\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. \"He says he did it because he loved her,\" Sarrafi said.\n\n\n\nAttack victims in Iran usually accept \"blood money\": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no.\n\n\n\n\"I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,\" Bahrami said. \"People like him should be made to feel my suffering.\"  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) \u00bb\n\n\n\nBahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot condone such cruel punishment,\" wrote one blogger. \"To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights.\"\n\n\n\nLate last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind. Neither does Bahrami.\n\n\n\n\"If I don't do this and there is another acid attack, I will never forgive myself for as long as I live,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBahrami is largely self-sufficient despite not being able to see. She can make a salad, prepare tea and walk up the five flights of stairs that lead to her parents' apartment.\n\n\n\nShe has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but she says there are many more to come.

Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus\n\n\n\nCalvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets.\n\n\n\nAfter taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.\n\n\n\nHe had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo \u00bb\n\n\n\nBilly was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.\n\n\n\nHe came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)\n\n\n\nCoolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.\n\n\n\nHe sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring.

It's true.\n\n\n\nHoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds.\n\n\n\nSound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests.\n\n\n\n3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion\n\n\n\nWhat do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog.\n\n\n\nIn 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend.\n\n\n\nFDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala.\n\n\n\nAfter that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went.\n\n\n\nThe dog \"gave\" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala.\n\n\n\nFala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone.\n\n\n\n\"You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious.\n\n\n\n\"He has not been the same dog since!\"\n\n\n\nFala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952.

(Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by \"Willie.\"  Watch Barney bite a reporter \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs \"Bush.\"\n\n\n\nThe name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben \"El Indio\" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher.\n\n\n\nOther first pets of note:\n\n\n\nMr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers.\n\n\n\nPauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption.\n\n\n\nOld Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco.\n\n\n\nLaddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 \"interview\" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs.\n\n\n\nLiberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations.\n\n\n\nSocks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie.\n\n\n\nGamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House.\n\n\n\nTwo tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo.\n\n\n\nSatan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno.\n\n\n\nJonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, \"partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs.\n\n\n\nJosiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course.\n\n\n\nBonus trivia: Checkers\n\n\n\nNixon's dog was immortalized in the \"Checkers speech,\" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nHe said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important?\n\n\n\nCheckers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket.\n\n\n\nAlthough the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964.\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "City of Los Angeles' Web ", "answer_start": "185"}], "question": "where Site raised $17,000 before crashing on Tuesday due to high volume?", "id": "154", "answers": [{"text": "A donation page ", "answer_start": "162"}, {"text": "the City of Los Angeles' Web ", "answer_start": "181"}, {"text": "City of Los Angeles' Web ", "answer_start": "185"}], "validated_answers": "{\"181:210\": 1, \"185:210\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "when Costs included extra police, sanitation, traffic control for?", "id": "591d96e1f4e818b4a739d2371a69518a38cNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The memorial service for singer Michael Jackson cost the city of Los Angeles $1.4 million, the mayor's office said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA donation page on the City of Los Angeles' Web site has crashed several times since its launch yesterday.\n\n\n\nCosts included putting extra police on the streets, trash pickup, sanitation, traffic control and more for the Tuesday event, spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said.\n\n\n\nThree thousand police officers -- almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force -- were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell, said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with the expenses.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday morning, hundreds of donors contributed more than $17,000 through the Web site.

Mitchell's defense attorneys have apparently indicated they will file a motion asking for a change of venue, as the case file said Kimball set a May 26 deadline for the motion and agreed to hear arguments before July 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee.

In exchange for the plea to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, state prosecutors dropped charges against Barzee in Smart's abduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors have recommended that Barzee serve a sentence of 15 years, but asked that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her participation in the case against Mitchell.

After the war, Terumasa (Ted) and Hidekazu (Dan) came back as United States citizens, and when the Korean War started, they volunteered also with the MIS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don\" Oka's memories of war are still vivid.

The ship was attacked and sunk by American planes. Teiji Oka was wounded and died several years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsao Oka, the oldest brother, was to ship out with the celebrated 442nd Japanese American Regimental Combat Team to Europe. Two days before, he heard the question, \"Who speaks Japanese?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe answered simply, \"I do!\" and was also transferred into the MIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsao Oka served in the Philippines and became known as the \"voice of American propaganda.\" Using shortwave radio, he broadcast Japanese music and read news and commentaries whose goal was to demoralize Japanese soldiers throughout the Pacific islands and urge the citizens of Japan to surrender.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 27, 1945, a day after it was released, he broadcast the Potsdam Declaration -- the terms of Japan's World War II surrender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how the reception was, but I was really happy the war was over\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasao, the second-oldest brother and last of them drafted, saw occupation duty in two of Japan's major cities, Kobe and Osaka.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Don Oka, the third-oldest brother, service wasn't always so metropolitan. On Tinian Island, he said, \"I saw bodies everywhere\" after a nine-day Marine battle there in 1944. Eight thousand Japanese were killed. By comparison, the 2nd and 4th Marine divisions lost 328 men. Hundreds of Japanese troops held out in the jungles for months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the camp's perimeter, he saw starving Japanese soldiers scavenging for food. He'd yell, in Japanese: \"War is over around here! Many Japanese have surrendered and are in camps under our care. Please come out and surrender!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe my Japanese was bad ... they didn't come out, \" Oka says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following summer, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew from Tinian airfield to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his duties on Tinian, Oka was asked to start a school for hundreds of Japanese and Korean children.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the war in the Pacific over, Oka helped Marines in occupied Japan. They scoured the countryside for the wreckage of downed American bombers and their missing servicemen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey never found survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\nOka was with the first U.S. Marine unit to meet Japanese civilians in the Shimonoseki region on the Japanese island of Kyushu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was a little frightened,\" he says of his initial contact with the Japanese civilians -- worried about perceptions that he, a Japanese-American, was consorting with the enemy. To his relief, he discovered that his shared heritage and translation skills, coupled with a respectful Marine presence, calmed everyone's fears.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe war in the Pacific ripped apart nations and families, and it divided loyalties. But Don Oka is pleased with all of his brothers' achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm kind of proud,\" he says of their military service. \"But at the same time, I really hate war from the beginning.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe adds: \"Those brothers of mine didn't hate me. I didn't hate them. We were brothers. We were just called to do the job, and we did it.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Muslim ", "answer_start": "360"}], "question": "What festival were the passengers traveling to?", "id": "40", "answers": [{"text": "Muslim ", "answer_start": "360"}, {"text": "of Eid al-Adha.\n", "answer_start": "376"}, {"text": "Muslim ", "answer_start": "360"}, {"text": "Bhola ", "answer_start": "346"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2}"}], "context": "(CNN) -- A ferry crammed with people capsized late Friday night in Bangladesh, killing at least 28 passengers, police said.\n\n\n\nThe boat had a capacity of 1,500, but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bangladesh's southern Bhola district.

By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through.\n\n\n\n\"It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,\" Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization.\n\n\n\nIt was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide.  Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River \u00bb\n\n\n\nA lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes.\n\n\n\nOne of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.\n\n\n\nA public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"\n\n\n\nThe federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"\n\n\n\nHornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.\n\n\n\n\"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.\n\n\n\nEngineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.\n\n\n\nSome 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council. The principal commodity passing through Markland is coal, which fuels numerous electric power plants along the Ohio River, and those plants typically stockpile only about a 30-day supply, the council said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "renew registration ", "answer_start": "977"}], "question": "What could the states refuse?", "id": "494", "answers": [{"text": "renew registration ", "answer_start": "977"}, {"text": "the manufacturer's fix has been made.

He was allowed to continue on his trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nPistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Alexey Pajitnov ", "answer_start": "178"}], "question": "Who is game's creator?", "id": "509", "answers": [{"text": "Alexey Pajitnov ", "answer_start": "178"}, {"text": "Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov ", "answer_start": "156"}, {"text": "Alexey Pajitnov ", "answer_start": "178"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What did Pajitnov say?", "id": "27559c30392652a463f892459a186a9fd46NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin.\n\n\n\nTetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version?\n\n\n\nPajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses.\n\n\n\nHe used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"Tetris,\" which comes from the Greek word for four, \"Tetra.\"\n\n\n\nIn the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between.

When you first dreamed up this scenario all those years ago, did you ever imagine it would turn into a global phenomenon?\n\n\n\nAlexey Pajitnov, Tetris creator: The very first time when my small game started working even without scoring or leveling, I couldn't stop playing. It's a really good game, but I [couldn't] imagine that it would be that big.\n\n\n\nHenk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software: When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988, I kept on coming back and playing more. And that was a for sure sign that this was going to be a good game.\n\n\n\nCNN: There are stories of people going in to work on the weekends just to sit at their computer and play for hours. They even dream the Tetris shapes if they play for too long. Could one of you explain to me why it's so addictive and what goes on when you play it?\n\n\n\nPajitnov: First of all, it's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it. So instead of destroying something, you kind of build up the profile out of those small pieces and enjoy doing it. And that's probably the very important addictive factor.\n\n\n\nCNN: The simplicity and also the immediate satisfaction -- but then immediately it's time to work for the next one.\n\n\n\nPajitnov: Yes.\n\n\n\nCNN: Henk, tell us some of the stunning statistics.\n\n\n\nRogers: Over 70 million products have been sold as a box product, and more recently on the mobile [market] we're almost reaching 80 million downloads worldwide.

What happened there and how did it ultimately pay out for you?\n\n\n\nPajitnov: Back in the '80s when I designed the game, the situation with intellectual property was very unclear in Russia. Communism Party didn't inspire some individual kind of activity. That's why I decided I granted my rights for Tetris for 10 years to Soviet Union to my computer center.

People approach me and say, \"I spent so much of my college time on Tetris I almost blow my exams.\" And I usually ask, \"But was it good hours which you spent on Tetris?\" And everybody say, \"Yes it was really good hours.\" So I say, \"I not waste it, I gift it to you!\"\n\n\n\nRogers: I think that Tetris is the first virtual sport.

Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches.\n\n\n\nToyota Prius: Green no matter its color\n\n\n\nBrinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius .\n\n\n\n\"Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,\" said Brinley. \"Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations.\"\n\n\n\nBell adds, \"New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club.\"\n\n\n\n\"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,\" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: \"There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world.\" We're just quoting here, folks.\n\n\n\nChevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis\n\n\n\nThe Chevy Corvette \"seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X.\" Bell adds: \"Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven.\"\n\n\n\nBetter car than its image suggests\n\n\n\nBell sees another side to the Corvette. \"It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,\" said Bell. \"It's an affordable giant-killer.\"\n\n\n\nMarkwalder adds, \"There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy.\"\n\n\n\nToyota Camry: A major transportation appliance\n\n\n\n\"I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,\" said Bell. \"It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car.\"\n\n\n\nDodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car\n\n\n\nThe Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y.\n\n\n\nAuto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. \"All ages stop and stare at this car,\" said Bell. \"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd.\" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging.\n\n\n\nFord F-150: Working man's truck\n\n\n\nAccording to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: \"Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living.\" Bell adds, \"We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine.\"\n\n\n\nMercedes-Benz R-Class: A marketing mystery\n\n\n\n\"With 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles, we don't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an R-Class,\" said Brinley. \"The more expensive GL-Class and ML-Class SUVs each sold three times as many.\" Markwalder states, \"The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality.\"\n\n\n\nBell quips, \"My experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three-pointed star (badge appeal) or the large discounts because the R-Class hasn't sold well.\" The R-class, a \"tweener\" that is somewhat minivan, somewhat wagon and somewhat crossover, has few rivals. Only the Ford Flex and the new Toyota Venza seem to come close.\n\n\n\nExperts' first thoughts\n\n\n\nBell on Chrysler Sebring Convertible: \"I hope it's a rental.\" Brinley adds, \"It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y.\" Bell on the Honda Insight: \"They're members of the Prius Alternative Club for Honda lovers.\" Markwalder on Smart ForTwo: \"Experimenters with a sense of humor who would rather sprint away from a light than hold up traffic.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "nearly $2 billion ", "answer_start": "79"}], "question": "How much is being spent on the clean up?", "id": "533", "answers": [{"text": "nearly $2 billion ", "answer_start": "79"}, {"text": "$2 billion ", "answer_start": "86"}], "validated_answers": "{\"86:97\": 1, \"79:97\": 2}"}], "context": "Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the \"Manhattan Project\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\" Peschong said. \"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\" Gill said. \"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \"glove box,\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hanford clean-up \"has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,\" according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean-up and the environment,\" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. \"They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost $2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up [to] happen with those dollars.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington State, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development council.\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was \"at a standstill\" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are on track to have best year ever,\" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable for several more generations since the Hanford clean-up project is expected to take another 40 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "United States ", "answer_start": "2182"}], "question": "North Korea recently threatened to \"wipe out\" what country  if provoked?", "id": "21", "answers": [{"text": "United States ", "answer_start": "2182"}, {"text": "Hawaii ", "answer_start": "535"}, {"text": "the United States ", "answer_start": "2178"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"2182:2196\": 2}"}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. officials are downplaying any imminent threat of a North Korean missile strike or confrontation between the two countries at sea.\n\n\n\nA U.S. official says North Korean leader Kim Jong Il seems to be \"testing the new administration.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community does not believe North Korea intends to launch a long-range missile in the near future, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN, despite reports in Japanese media citing intelligence that the North Korean regime intends to fire a missile toward Hawaii on July 4.\n\n\n\nShortly after that report, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he was deploying defensive measures around Hawaii.\n\n\n\nBut a recent warning to mariners issued by North Korea suggests the country only intends short- and medium-range missile tests, according to one U.S. intelligence official.\n\n\n\nThe North Korean government issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a \"military firing exercise,\" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN.\n\n\n\nThe North Koreans had issued a similar warning prior to testing a long-range missile in April, but that warning indicated two potential danger areas more indicative of a long-range missile test.\n\n\n\nThe official said that these shorter-range missiles can be \"rolled out on a dime,\" but the U.S. intelligence community sees no \"readily observable\" indication of an imminent long-range missile launch.\n\n\n\nVehicular activity had been spotted around a long-range missile site in late May, U.S. Defense Department officials told CNN at the time. But the officials said the activity was very preliminary, with no missile parts seen, and any launch would take a lot more time to prepare.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. intelligence official said there is always concern that a shorter-range test \"could go wrong,\" but for the most part the North Koreans have short and medium missile tests \"down pat,\" and those missiles are \"pretty accurate.\"\n\n\n\nThe official added, \"It's not particularly difficult to fire off\" short- and medium-range missiles.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea recently threatened to \"wipe out\" the United States if provoked.

The ship departed North Korea last week and is currently headed south toward Myanmar, U.S. officials believe.\n\n\n\nThe decision to enact the U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate will most likely not be made just by the United States but in coordination with other countries, Morrell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"That's a decision that will have to be made at some point, and not necessarily just by us or this government,\" Morrell said. \"But that is a decision I think we will likely take collectively with our allies and partners out there, and make a determination about whether we choose to hail and query this particular ship.

He also is expected to meet Tuesday evening with Tom Shannon, the top U.S. official on Latin America.\n\n\n\nEven as Zelaya spoke at the United Nations, his opponents held a large and noisy rally in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Crowd members waved blue and white Honduran flags and signs denouncing Zelaya.\n\n\n\nRoberto Micheletti, the new provisional president, briefly addressed the crowd Tuesday afternoon. He vowed that the next national elections, slated for November, will be held as planned, and that a new president will be sworn in as usual in January.\n\n\n\nGen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, the top Honduran military commander who had butted heads with Zelaya, also spoke at the rally.

The U.S. joined many other nations in co-sponsoring Tuesday's U.N. resolution.\n\n\n\nZelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled that the referendum was illegal, and Congress had voted not to hold it.\n\n\n\nThe high court also had overturned Zelaya's dismissal of Honduras' top general, who said the military would not participate in the referendum.

The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000.\n\n\n\nWhy does the commission have the power to impose such fines?\n\n\n\nEU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits.\n\n\n\nEU law is set up to \"protect consumers,\" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W. Bush were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits.\n\n\n\nThe EU could fine Intel (or any company) based on 10% of global annual revenues, but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the EU.\n\n\n\nCan Intel afford to pay this fine? What state is the company in at the moment?\n\n\n\nIntel reported first quarter revenue of $7 billion. It can easily afford this. Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard?\n\n\n\nAnother appeal will take months.

They got no response.\n\n\n\nHaines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet, over the Birmingham, Alabama, area, before the pilot parachuted to the ground.

There is increasing concern about harmful content on the Internet from violence, inciting racial hatred and terrorist activity, to sexual content and pornography, which justifies censorship on moral grounds,\" Al Khalifa said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for other aspects of the Middle East and its media, the report reveals several relative silver linings when it comes to press freedom: the environment in Lebanon, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanon has a \"far and more diverse and vibrant media than any other Arab country,\" but the institute found that \"most of Lebanon's media outlets are unduly influenced in their journalism content by powerful political figures to whom they are financially and politically beholden.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMills said the media in Lebanon can be characterized as \"partly free\" because there's a lot they don't talk about, such as criticism of military intelligence and the head of state, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, \"Israel has one of the most open media environments in the Middle East\" for Israeli journalists with a wide range of opinions and commentary.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Israeli security policy prevents Israeli journalists from traveling into the Palestinian territories without special permission, and Palestinian journalists are prevented from entering Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian security forces interfere with the work of Palestinian journalists, and that journalists in Gaza have to resort to self-censorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of speech and press in the United Arab Emirates gets \"some of the highest marks in the Arab world,\" but it \"still has a long way to go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report cited a \"number of taboo topics that journalists in the United Arab Emirates are not supposed to touch and indeed, most of the media do not,\" such as criticism of the ruling family. Across the Middle East, criticism of royal families and words perceived as insults to Islam have been criminalized.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Iraq, violence there has dropped and so has the number of journalists' deaths, but \"the U.S. military continues to imprison journalists without charge\" and local security forces have been responsible for beating journalists. There is concern about the rise of proposed legislation stifling media freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Syria, which has \"one of the world's worst records on media freedom,\" the media outlets are owned or controlled by the government. Political unrest elsewhere, the report said, is accompanied by media crackdowns, such as in Yemen, where there has been an insurgency in the north and civil unrest in the south. Elections in Algeria and Tunisia have also led to press freedom violations.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernments have controlled \"moral content\" as well, the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Saudi Arabia, several people involved in the production of a television show about sexual attitudes were sentenced to flogging and jail terms.

Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.\n\n\n\nLONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\nJet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.\n\n\n\nThe sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.\n\n\n\nThis is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.\n\n\n\nPractically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.\n\n\n\nAviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.\n\n\n\nPunitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n\nWe identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.\n\n\n\nThe 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.\n\n\n\nAircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nWe wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.\n\n\n\nWith the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel.\n\n\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it, it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling.\n\n\n\nWe have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit.\n\n\n\nOur competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge, which is passed on, in its entirety, to ClimateCare.\n\n\n\nBy acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place, we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners.\n\n\n\nWe believe that Jet Republic is at the forefront of modern European business. If every company in Europe could run 100 percent carbon neutral, as Jet Republic does, the world would be a better place."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "September ", "answer_start": "217"}], "question": "When will Twitter set up shop in Dublin?", "id": "29", "answers": [{"text": "September ", "answer_start": "217"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What ad tweter?", "id": "15f7bcec6ec88c49f68af2746eeed1210eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Ireland --- once Europe's 'Celtic Tiger' -- was last year felled by its black hole of a banking sector, and forced to tap Europe's bailout fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country continues to live off bailout funds -- yet in September internet giant Twitter announced its intention to set up headquarters in Dublin.

Nixon, right, and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici.\n\n\n\nDuring a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was \"very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field,\" according to the document.\n\n\n\nNixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows.\n\n\n\n\"We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,\" Nixon said. Medici said he was \"happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views\" were so close.\n\n\n\nThe declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\n\n\"This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],\" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it \"a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.\"\n\n\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records.\n\n\n\n\"I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments,\" Kornbluh said.\n\n\n\nHe added that \"there's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret, and we're going to have to press Brazil and Washington to recover those documents.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the leaders' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret, word got out.\n\n\n\nA declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a \"Cabinet leak.\" Gen. Vicente Dale Coutinho, commander of Brazil's 4th Army, reacted to this by saying that the United States obviously wanted Brazil \"to do the dirty work,\" it said.\n\n\n\nA declassified CIA national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded, \"Brazil will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors' internal affairs, but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes, to keep friendly governments in office, or to help place them there.\"\n\n\n\nThe newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of Brazilian involvement in the Chilean coup of 1973, which the Nixon administration supported.\n\n\n\nKornbluh said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved, the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the United States and Brazil in Chile can finally be told.\n\n\n\nThe National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.\n\n\n\nKornbluh said he also hopes that surviving Chilean government and military officers from the era who knew of any arrangements with the Brazilian government will come forward and tell their stories.\n\n\n\n\"This is history for history's sake, but history will not find closure until it's fully aired,\" he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Tigris ", "answer_start": "399"}], "question": "Which river has plunged to record low levels?", "id": "28", "answers": [{"text": "Tigris ", "answer_start": "399"}, {"text": "Tigris ", "answer_start": "399"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish, Iraqi and Syrian ministers met in Ankara on Thursday to discuss water shortages in the major Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which run through all three countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraqi fishermen ride their motor boat in the waters of the Tigris River in Baghdad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting comes amid a diplomatic spat over Iraqi accusations that Syria is harboring terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tigris River has plunged to record low levels, Iraqi farmers told CNN.

Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.\n\n\n\nAn injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.\n\n\n\nTwo days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.\n\n\n\n\"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBut after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\n\n\n\nWhen they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nThe McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\n\n\n\n\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.\n\n\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.\n\n\n\nMcCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nNow the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBut then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\n\n\n\n\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\n\n\n\nHere, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\n\n\n\n1. Be vigilant\n\n\n\nKeep an eye on someone who has hit his head, even if the person never lost consciousness. \"A lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you're not knocked out, you're OK, and that's not true,\" Ayotte says.\n\n\n\n2. Look for dizziness, vomiting, headache and confusion\n\n\n\nIf the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation.\n\n\n\n3. Look for changes in symptoms and behavior\n\n\n\nAny sudden change, such as Morgan's headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention. For example, Ghajar says, if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit, it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed.\n\n\n\n4. Be especially wary if someone a) has been drinking alcohol, b) is on blood thinners, c) is elderly or d) is a young athlete\n\n\n\nIt's tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior, so when in doubt, take the person to the hospital, Ghajar says. Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin.\n\n\n\nHe also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens. The CDC also has information on concussions in young athletes.\n\n\n\n5. Go to a certified trauma center if you can\n\n\n\nThe American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call. You can also look on this map from the American Trauma Society.

Now he's signed on for an engagement.\n\n\n\nCamera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites.\n\n\n\nYes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11.\n\n\n\nThis summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band.\n\n\n\nHe sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.)\n\n\n\n\"I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple. The music that I love, I find that most guys around me love, too,\" he told CNN in his dressing room after Thursday's news conference in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nThere's a big old-fashioned star on the door that says \"Garth Brooks.\" It suits him. Even though he's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry, he's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard, stay humble and family first. It's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000.\n\n\n\n\"We were retiring because I gotta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls. Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,\" he said. \"We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go. Go do what you gotta do. We'll be here when you get back,' and we'll see if they are.\"  Watch Brooks talk about new course \u00bb\n\n\n\nBrooks' three daughters -- Taylor, August and Allie -- are now 17, 15 and 13. When he retired, he famously stated that he wanted to be able to drive his kids to school every day. His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college.\n\n\n\nOf course, the commute from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger, courtesy of Steve Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know anything about jets,\" Brooks downplayed with a shrug. \"It's got a cool interior, cool paint job, I don't know. But it gets me here (to Vegas), and it gets me home to see my girls. And so in that case, it's fabulous.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's been happy being at home, attending every soccer game and knowing what his kids like to eat for breakfast,\" said singer Trisha Yearwood, whom he married in 2005. \"We both came from a family where our parents were there every single day, and so we don't know any other way.\"\n\n\n\nOn most weekends, Yearwood will be making the two-hour trip to Sin City -- and every now and again, she'll make an appearance with her husband on stage.\n\n\n\n\"It's a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing, you know?\" said Brooks. \"I can start a song in one octave and end it up in three keys, not knowing that I've changed. She's precision -- perfect with feeling -- and that's impressive to anybody you bring out.\"\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, Brooks will bring out special guests, but for the most part, it's a one-man show -- just him, an acoustic guitar and a bunch of great songs and intimate stories.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, there's the audience.\n\n\n\n\"As long as my gift is here, as long as I open my mouth and it works,\" he said, \"then I think my job is to keep doing it, you know?\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "civil disturbance call, ", "answer_start": "368"}], "question": "For what reason did police visit the actor's home?", "id": "345", "answers": [{"text": "civil disturbance call, ", "answer_start": "368"}, {"text": "in response to a civil disturbance call, ", "answer_start": "351"}, {"text": "civil disturbance call, ", "answer_start": "368"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Error harum eos est consequat Qui placeat maiores", "id": "4157d03434febb4414e8c92a0463774f446NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Sunt sed voluptatem voluptas dolor aspernatur aspernatur anim aut deleniti laborum quo aut dolorem sit rerum vitae minus ea dignissimos", "id": "766867a3b9495fc4f89b52040ca8da9a659NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Odit architecto maiores dolore voluptates nemo quia non qui reiciendis corrupti minus aut pariatur Sed aut qui", "id": "815b49a4bd96eee4fe4bc71cc394d44d25eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Former child actor Gary Coleman remained in a Utah jail Monday after being booked on an outstanding arrest warrant relating to a domestic violence case, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's still our guest here,\" Utah County sheriff's spokesman Lt.

He said: \"My biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending Israel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, two Israeli warships and a submarine made a rare journey through Egypt's Suez canal. Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, \"The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran. But it's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the North Koreans. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an Iranian bomb.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means, and Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy.

However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment.\n\n\n\nThe exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed.\n\n\n\nNewer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland.\n\n\n\n\"Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn't appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient's quality of life,\" he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head?\n\n\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all.\n\n\n\nThe team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal.\n\n\n\nBut not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms.\n\n\n\nSeveral antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States.\n\n\n\nAlthough peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients.\n\n\n\nBecause past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,\" Dr. Ford says. \"The problem with IBS is that it's a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history.\" Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS?\n\n\n\nThe study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P.

However, in her practice, she's found that prescription medications need to be used for severe cases that don't respond to these treatments.

Larry King anchors \"Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\n\n\nIn 1959, Bobby Darin, left, was Larry's first major guest on his WKAT radio program.\n\n\n\nLarry Zeiger left Brooklyn, New York, for Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of 23 to try to find a job in radio. This is how he got his new name:\n\n\n\nI went to stay with my Uncle Jack in Miami Beach.\n\n\n\nI was so excited that I started knocking on doors the next day.\n\n\n\nI stopped at a small station on First Street, WAHR. The guy in charge liked my voice. \"We get a lot of people coming and going,\" he told me. \"If you hang around, you'll get the first opening.\"\n\n\n\nI sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks. It was a tiny operation, but the sight of the UPI and AP machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like I was on the brink of something big. Miami Beach was like a dream. The palm trees. The ocean. I remember walking past Joe's Stone Crab. Joe's is more than a restaurant, it's a landmark.\n\n\n\nIt was full when I arrived in 1957, and I guarantee you, people will be waiting in line tomorrow night. I stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket, unable to afford a meal, looking at the happy faces, wondering what it would take to get into a place like that.\n\n\n\nThen came my big break. There was a morning deejay named Tom Baer. He was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty-five. He claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees. He quit on a Friday, and the general manager told me I could start on Monday.\n\n\n\nI must have rehearsed the entire weekend. I don't even think I slept. On Monday morning I showed up at WAHR with the record that would play my theme song, \"Swingin' Down the Lane.\"\n\n\n\nThe general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck. \"By the way,\" he said, \"what name are you going to use?\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"You can't use Larry Zeiger,\" he said. \"It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes. The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, \"King! How about Larry King?\"\n\n\n\n\"OK,\" I said. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. I wasn't going to blow it.\n\n\n\n\"Fine. You'll host The Larry King Show.\"\n\n\n\nNine o'clock was approaching. That's when the news came on. A few minutes later, The Larry King Show would make its debut. I went through the control-room door, sat down, and set up my record. The news ended. I started my theme song, then faded down the music so I could introduce myself. I opened my mouth. It was as dry as cotton. For the first time in my life, I couldn't speak.\n\n\n\nSo I brought \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" up again and faded it once more. Again, not a single word came out of my mouth.\n\n\n\nI could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart. I'd waited for this moment my whole life. How could I be blowing it? Once more, I cranked up \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" -- but not a word came out of me.\n\n\n\nThe next thing I knew, the general manager was kicking open the door to the control room. \"This is a communications business!\" he roared in a way that only a general manager can. Then he turned, walked out, and slammed the door behind him.\n\n\n\nShaken, I leaned in to the microphone and said, \"Good morning. This is my first day ever on the radio. I've always wanted to be on the air. I've been practicing all weekend. A few minutes ago, they gave me my new name. I've had a theme song ready to play, but my mouth is dry. I'm nervous. And the general manager just kicked open the door and said, 'This is a communications business!'\"\n\n\n\nThat's how my career started on May 1, 1957. Years later, Arthur Godfrey would tell me, \"The only secret in this business is...there is no secret.\" He was right. I learned a great lesson on my first day. There's no trick to being yourself. I don't think I've ever been nervous on the air since then."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "18th ", "answer_start": "97"}], "question": "How many years did he win the title?", "id": "627", "answers": [{"text": "fifth successive season ", "answer_start": "62"}, {"text": "fifth ", "answer_start": "62"}, {"text": "18th ", "answer_start": "97"}], "validated_answers": "{\"97:102\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "How many points behind did Roma finish?", "id": "409efecfb46132e44f892a87ab75bd7b9a3NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Inter Milan have won the Italian Serie A title for a fifth successive season -- and the 18th time in their illustrious history -- after Diego Milito's goal gave them a 1-0 win at Siena on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJose Mourinho's side needed nothing less than a victory to secure the Scudetto and they achieved that feat in the 57th-minute when striker Milito collected a pass from fellow-Argentine Javier Zanetti, before firing home a shot with the outside of his right foot.\n\n\n\n\n\nA draw would have allowed second-placed Roma to snatch the title with a win at Chievo and Claudio Ranieri's side kept up their side of the deal with a 2-0 success.\n\n\n\n\n\nMirko Vucinic volleyed home Daniele De Rossi's through-ball in the 39th minute and Italian international De Rossi added a second on the stroke of half-time with a superb long-range strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith only 45 minutes remaining of the season, Roma were in pole position to win their first title since 2001 -- but Milito's strike ensured Inter became the first team since Juventus in the 1930's to win five titles on the bounce.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result, which condemned Siena to relegation to Serie B alongside Atalanta and Livorno, also means Inter Milan will now face Bayern Munich in next weekend's Champions League final in Madrid with both sides bidding for a unique treble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an incredible joy, a reward for all the hard work we've put in over the year,\" Milito told reporters. \"From tomorrow we will think about that great Champions Lague final.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the Bavarian giants, Inter have now added the league title to their domestic cup triumph -- and Saturday's Bernabeu showdown now ensures one of the two teams will secure a rare treble of trophies this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mourinho, who has overseen Inter's last two Scudetto wins, there is the added incentive of joining a select band of coaches to have won the Champions League with two different clubs, following his success with Porto in 2004."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "cortisone.\n", "answer_start": "434"}], "question": "What did Cannavaro test positive for?", "id": "282", "answers": [{"text": "cortisone.\n", "answer_start": "434"}, {"text": "medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone.\n", "answer_start": "389"}, {"text": "cortisone.\n", "answer_start": "434"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who interviewed the Defender?", "id": "100c0052071e6964e48aa66d39749b00194NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy.\n\n\n\nFabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory.\n\n\n\nIt was revealed on Thursday that the 36-year-old Juventus defender recently failed a drug test after taking a medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone.\n\n\n\nCannavaro was interviewed by the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI) anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri on Thursday night in Turin but national coach Marcello Lippi does not expect his star to be absent from the squad.\n\n\n\n\"I have not spoken to Cannavaro,\" Lippi told reporters. \"Will he be here with us on Sunday?

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has had half-naked activists campaign against meat consumption by covering themselves in fake blood and lying in human-sized meat packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nPETA's theatrics may seem a far cry from a bake sale, but the organization sees the sales and protests as means of reaching the same goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if [people] don't like the medium that we're using to get things across, we really just try to make sure they understand why we're doing it,\" said PETA senior campaigner Ashley Byrne.\n\n\n\n\n\nGary Loewenthal, director of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, said he believes bake sales can be a nice change of pace for people used to more confrontational forms of activism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I liked it because it combined this time-honored, well-liked tradition with vegan outreach,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe started planning last year's event from his home in Falls Church, Virginia, after brainstorming fundraising opportunities with Compassion for Animals, the animal advocacy group he helps run.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoewenthal sent invitations to cities all over the world and soon generated a buzz online. In 2009, the event had close to 100 participants and raised more than $25,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach group decides where to direct the proceeds of its own bake sale. While the money is not required to go to any specific type of organization, many opt to donate to nonprofit groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo events in Seattle, Washington, last week raised $1,770 for Pigs Peace Sanctuary, where Edgar, a potbellied pig, is being treated for a broken leg.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunds from a vegan bake sale in California on Sunday will benefit breast cancer research and education through the Avon Foundation. A group in Louisiana will send its proceeds to Food For Life, a vegan hunger-relief organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Loewenthal started researching vegan bake sales in 2008, a Google search yielded few results. Now, he says, one can find at least a handful of them taking place in any given month.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late January, more than 25 U.S. cities held vegan bake sales to raise money for Haiti hurricane relief. They were able to donate more than $75,000, according to organizer Isa Moskowitz, author of a number of vegan cookbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing popularity of vegan bake sales makes Loewenthal think about the future of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got some ideas going forward about how to keep it fresh,\" he said. \"But we're also prepared for it to be obsolete. ... We can call it a success and go on to something else.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "the ", "answer_start": "112"}], "question": "is the zetas cartel from the veracruz state", "id": "1078", "answers": [{"text": "the ", "answer_start": "112"}, {"text": "of ", "answer_start": "122"}, {"text": "the ", "answer_start": "112"}, {"text": "of ", "answer_start": "122"}, {"text": "of the ", "answer_start": "87"}, {"text": "the ", "answer_start": "112"}, {"text": "of ", "answer_start": "122"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "that group released a video on the internet", "id": "99a4878564f6a44232af82a1e39216dcb7NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "the authorities will do something about it", "id": "35357293b0dbc364165abf8122218d40f8cNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what is this group zeta killers", "id": "64458cc5c95799e4068961e77f39567abb6NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- A video purporting to be from a vigilante group whose goal is the eradication of the Zetas cartel from the state of Veracruz, Mexico, has surfaced on the Internet, but its credibility remains unproven.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive masked men dressed in black appear on the video, sitting behind a long table.

Hidary co-founded a technology company, Earth Web/Dice, and a financial research company, Vista Research. He works currently in the fields of clean energy technology and policy and is chairman of SmartTransportation.org which successfully pushed for the use of hybrid cars as taxis in New York City.\n\n\n\nJack Hidary says the Cash for Clunkers program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy.\n\n\n\nNEW YORK (CNN) -- Our country is facing a daunting economic challenge this year and we must take steps to pull ourselves out of this ditch.\n\n\n\nOne such program that has hit the ground running is Cash for Clunkers. It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?\n\n\n\nThe Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce your chances of becoming a statistic by getting the most safety for your dollar -- and with the Clunkers program you can now do that more affordably.\n\n\n\nAs a co-architect of the federal Cash for Clunkers program with the Center for American Progress and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and adviser to various congressional offices on the issue, it is gratifying to see how quickly it has been adopted by the American people. It achieves multiple goals -- it stimulates auto sales, increases the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and makes us safer.\n\n\n\nLet's support this program by encouraging our friends and neighbors to finally retire that guzzler and help the country with the purchase of a cleaner, lower maintenance car for the future.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack D. Hidary."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "intends to follow up with ", "answer_start": "1937"}], "question": "Will Lieberman investigate further?", "id": "3", "answers": [{"text": "intends to follow up with ", "answer_start": "1937"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is the reason?", "id": "39364d0862d30d4f6f9804d7d591e81d4bNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who is going to investigate?", "id": "56066b36db7b2cb403eab518709c3d0d058NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who will investigate further", "id": "56816f70f70300f4253a54df8453b9bc7caNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what did they do", "id": "612e640ab969910486c9e405ba28b70239dNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.\n\nRaymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.\n\nOne of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.\n\nTwo immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.\n\nBoth are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.

Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers.\n\n\"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\"\n\nACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\"\n\nResponding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003.\n\nFrom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said.\n\n\"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said.\n\nShe added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations.\n\nBut both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.\n\nSoeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected\n\n\"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English.\n\nHe says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.\n\nSoeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.\n\nIn the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.\n\nICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.\n\n\"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\"\n\nBut, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document\n\nThat's when, he says, \"I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.\"\n\nA government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.\n\nIn both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation.\n\nSoeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. \"I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,\" he says. \"What they did to me was very, very bad.\" E-mail to a friend\n\nCNN's Wayne Drash, Traci Tamura and Gregg Cane contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "several weeks, ", "answer_start": "575"}], "question": "How long will the examination take?", "id": "449", "answers": [{"text": "several weeks, ", "answer_start": "575"}, {"text": "several weeks, ", "answer_start": "575"}, {"text": "several weeks, ", "answer_start": "575"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- A sheriff's deputy who killed six young people at a house party in Crandon, Wisconsin, apparently died after shooting himself three times in the head with a .40-caliber pistol, the state attorney general said.\n\n\n\nTyler Peterson, a sheriff's deputy, shot and killed six people, police said.\n\n\n\nInitial reports that 20-year-old Tyler Peterson was killed by a police sniper's bullet were apparently incorrect, though it appears the sniper may have shot Peterson in the arm, Attorney General J.B.

After momentarily losing sight of Peterson, Carter \"heard multiple rounds of gunfire\" and his windshield burst.\n\n\n\nPeterson escaped. Van Hollen said that Peterson apparently \"drove aimlessly around the northern part of the state\" for several hours, calling in false reports to police to throw them off.\n\n\n\nPeterson  ended up at a cabin in the town of Argonne shortly before 8 a.m. He told friends about the shootings, handed over the AR-15 and two other rifles and left the cabin. After meeting with family members, he returned to the cabin around 9:15 a.m.\n\n\n\nPolice arrived about 15 minutes later, Van Hollen said. Peterson was killed during a police shootout after police couldn't persuade him to surrender.\n\n\n\nAll seven victims were students or graduates of Crandon High School, from which Peterson also was a graduate.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Murray, the dead were identified as Aaron Smith, Bradley Schultz, Lindsey Stahl, Lianna Thomas and Katrina McCorkle.\n\n\n\nThe sole survivor, Charlie Neitzel, 21, \"played dead\" after Peterson shot him three times, Van Hollen said.\n\n\n\nAfter Peterson shot him once, Neitzel begged him to stop.

He's reported in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, where he's been in a private room since the incident.\n\n\n\nGordon Weekes, the attorney for Bent, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults.\n\n\n\n\"It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared toward rehabilitation,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWeekes said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond.\n\n\n\nDetectives say witnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. They said Matthew Bent encouraged the attack.\n\n\n\nAuthorities say Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a \"bad decision,\" according to an arrest transcript.\n\n\n\nDetectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer.

Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks; his face and hands were largely spared, doctors say.\n\n\n\nBrewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries.\n\n\n\n\"They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time,\" said Lorraine Nelson, a hospital spokeswoman.\n\n\n\n\"I don't tell him what happened,\" Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. \"I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better.\n\n\n\n\"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?'

When Brewer did not pay, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, police say. When Brewer reported him to the police, Bent was arrested.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the group surrounded Brewer. The five boys called Brewer \"a snitch\" and set him on fire, witnesses said.\n\n\n\nThe Brewer family told WFOR that none of the families of the accused boys have tried to contact them, but it doesn't matter.\n\n\n\n\"We can't focus on it.

Piedad Cordoba, right, of Colombia reportedly is one of three top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nSen. Piedad Cordoba is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders, said the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute. The others the institute named are Jordanian Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a philosophy professor in Islamic faith at Jordan University, and Afghan physician and human rights activist Sima Samar.\n\n\n\nThough the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute.\n\n\n\n\"It really is quite open this year,\" Harpviken said.\n\n\n\nThis year's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations. The committee does not release the names of the nominees.\n\n\n\nThe 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict.\n\n\n\n\"This is a [Nobel] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.\n\n\n\nSince 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more. Colombian officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives.\n\n\n\nA government critic and longtime peace activist, Cordoba was kidnapped by a right-wing paramilitary group in 1999. She was released after several weeks and then fled to Canada with her family, where she stayed for 14 months before returning home. There have been at least two assassinations attempts against her.\n\n\n\n\"While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize,\" PRIO said in a release.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about Cordoba, whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels. \"I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia,\" he said. \"That's not terribly surprising.\"\n\n\n\nCordoba was nominated by Argentinean human rights activist Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate. \"Certainly, the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong,\" Harpviken said.\n\n\n\nA member of the Jordanian royal family and educated at Princeton and Cambridge universities, where he received a doctorate, Muhammad, 42, \"is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue,\" PRIO said.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the prince brought together 170 Islamic scholars from 40 countries for the Amman Initiative to work out what they called a \"theological counter-attack against terrorism.\"\n\n\n\nTwo years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called \"A Common Word Between Us and You\" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians.\n\n\n\nThe letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam. Backing his words with his deeds, Muhammad gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited Jordan this year.\n\n\n\n\"The importance of Prince Ghazi's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages Islamic theology, institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between Islam and other faiths, thereby contributing a wider platform for interreligious dialogue for Muslims in general,\" PRIO said. \"A prize to Prince Ghazi would also be recognition of the long-standing efforts of the Jordanian royal family, including King Abdullah, who have been long-standing proponents of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.\"\n\n\n\nIf Muhammad does not win, Harpviken said, it could be because his work is not done.\n\n\n\n\"He still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact,\" Harpviken said.\n\n\n\nThe third PRIO front-runner is Samar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the U.N. special envoy to Darfur in Africa.\n\n\n\nA medical doctor, Samar also established the Shuhada Organization, which focuses on health care, particularly for Afghan women.\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining her medical degree in 1982, Samar and her son fled to Pakistan in 1984 when the communist regime then ruling Afghanistan arrested her husband.\n\n\n\nSamar, 52, remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration.\n\n\n\n\"She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,\" PRIO said, adding that she \"does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to other published reports, another possible pick is monk Thich Quang Do, head of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. He has been under house arrest since 2001 and has been in and out of jail since his first detention by communist authorities in 1977.\n\n\n\nQuang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006.\n\n\n\nFour recent Rafto winners have gone on to garner the Nobel Peace Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (also known as Burma), Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Shirin Ebadi of Iran.\n\n\n\nAzerbaijani journalist and human rights activist Malahat Nasibova was awarded the Rafto this year and also is considered a possible Nobel prize winner.\n\n\n\nChinese dissidents Hu Jia, Gao Zhisheng and Wei Jingsheng also are contenders, other observers said.\n\n\n\nAfter months of house arrest, Hu, 36, was detained in December 2007 during a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in April 2008 for \"inciting subversion of state power.\"\n\n\n\nHu started his activism focusing on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and co-founded a grassroots organization dedicated to helping children from AIDS families. The international human rights group Amnesty International said Hu's focus broadened and he began reporting on a wider human rights violations in China, even giving interviews to international journalists.\n\n\n\nAmnesty said Hu has been repeatedly beaten and harassed by police for his outspokenness. Before being arrested, he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in Beijing.\n\n\n\nGao, who was born in 1966, is a self-taught lawyer and People's Liberation Army veteran who was a Nobel Peace Prize candidate last year. He disappeared in February after being taken away by Chinese police. Fellow activists say he is believed to still be alive.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, he wrote a letter to the U.S. Congress urging the United States to boycott the Olympic Games held in Beijing the following year. In it, he described a wide array of human rights violations by the Chinese government -- from lack of property and religious rights to environmental disasters to Tibet.\n\n\n\n\"I ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality, justice, and humanity, as well as to what extent such values are undermined in China,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWei, 59, was first arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years. He was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years. In 1997, Chinese authorities put him on a plane to the United States, where he has lived since.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best known of the Chinese dissidents, Wei has been awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the National Endowment for Democracy Award and the Olof Palme Memorial Prize. He has been nominated seven times for the peace prize.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he doubts the Nobel committee will choose any Chinese or Russian dissidents this year because they \"don't want to anger powerful governments.\"\n\n\n\n\"Although the committee takes pride in being independent,\" he said, \"there are certain limitations on their being independent.\"\n\n\n\nThat does not mean he doesn't expect the committee to \"take daring decisions.\"\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he believes that \"the most likely expression of the committee's courage this year will be to award the prize either to an unconventional kind of candidate or to somebody whose work is likely to be directly helped by a prize award.\"\n\n\n\nThe peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded.\n\n\n\nWhile the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\n\n\n\nThe Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million.\n\n\n\nCNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce ", "answer_start": "289"}], "question": "With what organization Al-Maliki has business talks?", "id": "1062", "answers": [{"text": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce ", "answer_start": "289"}, {"text": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce ", "answer_start": "289"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "When U.S. energy firm secured a deal of Iraqi contract?", "id": "4824a1f32dfabbb46adb25316c5cb04af2cNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- As the United States completes its withdrawal of all military forces from Iraq by the end of the month, Iraq's prime minister made a pitch to leaders of American commerce and industry Tuesday: Iraq is open for business.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an address to American executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said his country offers \"limitless\" opportunities for American companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Maliki said his country is trying to diversify from an energy-dominated economy, to one that focuses on financial, medical, agricultural, educational and infrastructure services as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of U.S. military operations in Iraq heralds the beginning of a \"wider relationship\" between the two countries where \"not generals but businessmen\" will focus on economic and political engagement between the two countries, al-Maliki told the audience. He spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum, engineering and construction, commercial aviation, architecture, maritime cargo and financial services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U.S. investment in Iraq has increased since 2008, al-Maliki said Iraq wants to see a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of Iraqis and create more U.S. jobs in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal foreign direct investment in Iraq hit $70 billion for the first months of 2011, according to the chamber.

That figure represents 11.6% of all investment entering Iraq, the chamber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has projected the Iraqi economy to grow at a faster pace than China or India over the next two to three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite growing U.S. investment in Iraq, the chamber continued its own pitch to U.S. businesses of the potential Iraq represents for them, and American workers, before al-Maliki spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to trail our trading partners with respect to investment and economic engagement in Iraq,\" said Lionel Johnson, vice president for Middle East and North African Affairs at the chamber. The private sector stands to play a crucial role in filling the capacity void left in many sectors of the Iraqi economy following the U.S. military departure, Johnson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning business for American firms in Iraq has not been an easy prospect in the past. Not a single U.S. energy firm secured a deal for oil production at an auction of contracts by the Iraqi government two years ago. Many members of Congress were outraged, and questioned the U.S. investment in Iraq to that point after lucrative multi-billion-dollar contracts went to Russian and Chinese firms instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past year, the United States Business Council in Iraq was established to advance commercial interests for American firms operating in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity aside, al-Maliki acknowledged the difficulty of moving his country from the planned economy of the Saddam Hussein era to a market-based system governed by transparency laws and international regulations, not to mention convincing American businesses to invest in a country that still experiences a high volume of violence. He assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake, this is a country that's developing, its commerce is developing, it's going to take time, it's going to take energy,\" Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides told CNN after al-Maliki spoke. \"U.S. companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that's what it is about, and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments.

DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify \u00bb\n\n\n\nRicci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke.

The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.\n\n\n\nNew Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.\n\n\n\nThe question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.\n\n\n\nBased on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law.

To prepare for the film, Cruise flew in the backseat of an F-14 several times, including once with Altman.\n\n\n\n\"The actors were all pretty easy to get along with. Tom Cruise, for example, was very motivated,\" recalled Altman, who is making his fourth trip into space this week. \"He enjoyed flying. He listened to what we told him and became a pilot himself after that.\"\n\n\n\nAltman is not one to brag about his flying in \"Top Gun.\" The U.S. space agency, NASA, doesn't mention his film heroics, either. But Altman is in one of the movie's most memorable scenes. While flying upside down, inverted, Altman gives an obscene gesture to the pilot of an enemy plane.\n\n\n\n\"They said go ahead and gesture at the other airplane,\" said Altman, 49, with a smile. \"So when you're looking at the scene where he's communicating with the Russian, or the bad-guy pilots in the movie, that would be my finger.\"\n\n\n\nBut the flying scenes with the actors didn't all work out as director Tony Scott had hoped.\n\n\n\n\"The director had to pay $7,600 an hour to rent an airplane,\" Altman recalled. \"But after a week of spending that much money on the airplanes, he decided he couldn't use the footage. The actors all looked a little green, he said.\"\n\n\n\nAltman and the other pilots earned $23 a day for their trouble.\n\n\n\nBut his biggest disappointment was not getting to see the film as soon as it was released. He and the other pilots were invited to a preview screening, but a commanding officer would not let them go.\n\n\n\nAnd by the time the movie hit theaters, Altman was busy. He was overseas, on another seven-month tour of duty."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Raymond \"Chuck\" Foster, ", "answer_start": "334"}], "question": "who have son ?", "id": "103", "answers": [{"text": "Raymond \"Chuck\" Foster, ", "answer_start": "334"}, {"text": "Raymond \"Chuck\" Foster, ", "answer_start": "334"}, {"text": "Foster, ", "answer_start": "789"}], "validated_answers": "{\"bad_question\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who is Cynthia Lynch?", "id": "4999b2d6a8f8cda445fae7023d4eb54b536NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaymond \"Chuck\" Foster is reputed to be the leader of the Klan Group.

Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise -- something scientists say will not happen. Still, skeptics have filed suit to try to stop the project.   It even has a rap dedicated to it on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists say the collider is finally ready for an attempt to circulate a beam of protons the whole way around the 17-mile tunnel. The test, which takes place Wednesday, is a major step toward seeing if the the immense experiment will provide new information about the way the universe works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really a generation that we've been looking forward to this moment, and the moments that will come after it in particular,\" said Bob Cousins, deputy to the scientific leader of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. \"September 10 is a demarcation between finishing the construction and starting to turn it on, but the excitement will only continue to grow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe collider consists of a particle accelerator buried more than 300 feet near Geneva, Switzerland. About $10 billion have gone into the accelerator's construction, the particle detectors and the computers, said Katie Yurkewicz, spokewoman for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is host to the collider.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. It will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, and the experiments could generate enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. Check out the collider complex's six detectors \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the unknown\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say the collider has the potential to confirm theories about questions that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson, which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot \"soup\" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a detector specialized to analyze that question.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,\" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should the layperson care about this particular exploration? Years ago, when electrons were first identified, no one knew what they were good for, but they have since transformed our entire economy, said Howard Gordon, deputy research program manager for the collider's ATLAS experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better,\" said Gordon, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. \"It's important for just who we are, what we are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack hole fears are \"baloney\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. A study released Friday by CERN scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny, and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Huth, who works on the collider's ATLAS experiment, called such fears \"baloney\" in a recent interview, and noted that in normal physics, even if the black hole were stable, it could just pass through the Earth without being detected or without interacting at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The gravitational force is so weak that you'd have to wait many, many, many, many, many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could [get] big enough to even get close to being a problem,\" said Huth, professor of physics at Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the scene\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen visiting the general-purpose detectors CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider, Lykken said he was awed that 30,000 tons of electronics would have to work without anyone fiddling with them all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It just blows you away to look at these things and realize they're not only incredibly complex and huge, but they have to actually work,\" he said. \"They have to work without people banging on them all day because they're sitting underground all by themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith twice as much iron as the Eiffel Tower, CMS will run at full power for the first time in conjunction with the first beam test Wednesday, Lykken said. The magnet serves to bend particles, whizzing by at almost the speed of light, to figure out what kind of particles they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the detector's parts weigh thousands of tons, in previous trials of CMS at lower power, the magnet actually yanked certain parts around because of its power, Lykken said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're talking about such incredible power inside both the accelerator and detectors that you never really know until you turn it all on what's going to happen,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists around the world are pumped for the first beam. Fermilab, the high energy physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, and major collaborator on the Large Hadron Collider, will be host of a \"pajama party\" at 1:30 a.m. CT that includes a live connection to CERN to follow the action.\n\n\n\n\n\nCousins believes that because the collider pushes the frontiers of science and technology, it would be \"amazingly impressive if it works the first try,\" he said in a phone interview from CERN. Any little disturbance of the magnetic field anywhere in the tunnel could stop the beam from making it all the way around.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, after a 25-year wait, he's not complaining. \"I personally will be fine if there's some problem that has to be overcome in the next few days,\" he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "the Stars\" judges ", "answer_start": "3854"}], "question": "Who has Wozniak not been a hit with?", "id": "551", "answers": [{"text": "the \"Dancing ", "answer_start": "3836"}, {"text": "the Stars\" judges ", "answer_start": "3854"}, {"text": "lowest combined score ", "answer_start": "804"}, {"text": "\"Dancing ", "answer_start": "3840"}, {"text": "the Stars\" judges ", "answer_start": "3854"}], "validated_answers": "{\"3854:3872\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who is the host of \"Dancing With the Stars\"?", "id": "289eea6a01967e643ffb043c88428d785ddNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- What he lacks in technique, Steve Wozniak makes up for in geeks.\n\n\n\nApple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak and his partner show off their moves on \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\n\n\nThe Apple Inc. co-founder has managed to transform his less-than-graceful moves on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars\" into enough votes to keep hope alive on the competitive ballroom-dance show.\n\n\n\n\"Woz,\" as he is known by friends and fans alike, and partner Katarina Smirnoff have had some of the lowest scores from the trio of judges since the show premiered on March 9.\n\n\n\nBut the judges, who are experts in the field of competitive dance, aren't the only deciding factor.\n\n\n\nViewers can vote online, via phone calls or by text messaging, and those votes comprise 50 percent of each couple's score.

You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient.\n\n\n\nTechnicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results.\n\n\n\nAll mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year.

Mark Sanford to consider resigning from office.\n\n\n\nGov. Mark Sanford has said it's better for him to keep his governorship to \"learn lessons.\"\n\n\n\n\"For the past two days, I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina,\" she said in a statement. \"There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight, so that he can devote his efforts full-time to repairing the damage in his personal life.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down.\n\n\n\nCNN has learned that GOP Sens. Daniel Verdin, Shane Martin, Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor's resignation to 13. There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate.\n\n\n\nAnother state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday. Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him \"to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state.\"\n\n\n\nSanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign. He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning, \"I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm.\"\n\n\n\nAfter returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife didn't know about, Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's \"crossed lines\" with other women, although Chapur was the only one he had sex with.  Watch a report on Sanford's situation \u00bb\n\n\n\nSanford's support among legislators and grassroots leaders in the state eroded considerably Tuesday after Sanford told The Associated Press he had met with his mistress more times than he had previously disclosed. He also admitted to dalliances with other women.\n\n\n\nAt least four county GOP chairmen have also called for Sanford to go.\n\n\n\nGlenn McCall, the York County Republican Party chairman who has been leading a grassroots effort against the governor, said Wednesday that he and other conservative activists are postponing a rally at the State House next week because legislators are starting to come out strongly against Sanford.\n\n\n\nThe rally had been scheduled to pressure Senate and House leaders to call for Sanford's resignation and start an investigation into his activities. But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford's travel records, McCall said the rally may not be necessary.\n\n\n\n\"We are hoping that legislators can quietly, in private talks with the governor, ask him if he would please step down,\" McCall said.\n\n\n\nA top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford's resignation Wednesday. \"While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford's abuse of power, [through] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [down],\" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford's extramarital affair, which we learn more about every few hours.\n\n\n\n\"... South Carolina can't afford to be at a standstill for the next 18 months with a governor who ignores his job responsibilities while pursuing personal interests,\" the statement said. \"Any other worker in South Carolina would be fired for not showing up at work with no notice.\"\n\n\n\nLate Tuesday, seven GOP senators, including Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, jointly issued a letter demanding that the governor step down because he has lost the trust of South Carolinians.\n\n\n\n\"The bottom line is that the Governor's private matters should remain private, but his deception and negligence make it impossible for us to trust him, and for him to govern in the future,\" they wrote.\n\n\n\nPeeler told CNN that Sanford \"has lost his ability to lead, and I'm afraid he has lost his ability to function as a man.\"\n\n\n\n\"He is sitting all alone in that big governor's mansion, totally alone,\" Peeler said. \"It's about leadership and moving forward and it's time for him to resign.\"\n\n\n\nPeeler issued the statement along with Sens. Hugh Leatherman, Paul Campbell, Thomas Alexander, Jake Knotts, Larry Martin and William O'Dell.\n\n\n\nEarlier Tuesday, two of Sanford's top conservative allies in the senate -- Larry Grooms and Kevin Bryant -- also said Sanford must go.\n\n\n\nThe Greenville News, one of the largest papers in South Carolina, also issued a sharply worded editorial Wednesday telling Sanford to go. It wrote that Sanford has \"acted like a heart-sick school boy, and he's revealed facts that clearly demonstrate he is capable of exceptional deception, arrogance and narcissism.\"\n\n\n\nThe State, of Columbia, South Carolina's largest paper, editorialized earlier that he should remain in office.  Watch a reporter from The State comment on the situation \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe attorney general of South Carolina asked the State Law Enforcement Division to review Sanford's travel records after the governor admitted Tuesday to more visits with his mistress than previously disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe review by law enforcement officials would be the first formal investigation into whether Sanford abused his power while carrying on his affair.\n\n\n\nState Law Enforcement Division Chief Reggie Lloyd said he would not characterize the review as a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\nHe told reporters on a conference call that law enforcement officials are reviewing documents from the governor's office going back to 2003, when Sanford came to power. He said the review should be concluded by the end of the week.\n\n\n\nAttorney General Henry McMaster, a Republican, had been reluctant to move forward with calls for an investigation into Sanford, saying he is wary of mixing legal matters with political score-settling from longtime Sanford opponents. However, an aide to McMaster told CNN on Tuesday that \"that all changed this morning when the governor disclosed additional trips that were not disclosed last week.\"\n\n\n\nSanford said in a statement Tuesday that he's \"pleased that [the State Law Enforcement Division] will look into this matter.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness.

And his Japanese ex-wife -- a fugitive in the United States for taking his children from Tennessee -- is considered the victim.\n\n\n\n\"Japan is an important partner and friend of the U.S., but on this issue, our points of view differ,\" the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Tuesday. \"Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan.\"\n\n\n\nThe story begins in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, with the January divorce of Savoie from his first wife, Noriko, a Japanese native. The ex-wife had agreed to live in Franklin to be close to the children, taking them to Japan for summer vacations.\n\n\n\nSavoie in March requested a restraining order to prevent his ex-wife from taking the children to Japan, saying she had threatened to do so, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate WTVF and posted on the station's Web site. A temporary order was issued, but then lifted following a hearing.\n\n\n\n\"If Mother fails to return to Tennessee [after summer vacation] with the children following her visitation period, she could lose her alimony, child support and education fund, which is added assurance to Father that she is going to return with the children,\" Circuit Court Judge James G. Martin III noted in his order on the matter.\n\n\n\nAfter that ruling, Christopher Savoie tried to have Martin recuse himself, as he was a mediator in the case prior to becoming a judge, said Marlene Eskind Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney. But that request was denied, as Savoie earlier said he had no concerns about Martin hearing the matter.\n\n\n\nFollowing the summer trip, Noriko Savoie did return to the United States, and Christopher Savoie then took the children on a vacation, returning them to his ex-wife, his attorney, Paul Bruno, told CNN.  Watch latest report on Savoie's situation \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut days later, on the first day of classes for 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca, the school called Savoie to say his children hadn't arrived, Bruno said. Police checked Noriko Savoie's home and did not find the children.\n\n\n\nConcerned, Savoie called his ex-wife's father in Japan, who told him not to worry.\n\n\n\n\"I said, 'What do you mean -- don't worry? They weren't at school.' 'Oh, don't worry, they are here,' \" Savoie recounted the conversation to CNN affiliate WTVF earlier this month. \"I said, 'They are what, they are what, they are in Japan?' \"\n\n\n\nThe very thing that Savoie had predicted in court papers had happened -- his wife had taken their children to Japan and showed no signs of returning, Bruno said.\n\n\n\nAfter Noriko Savoie took the children to Japan, Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children, Bruno said. And Franklin police issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife, the television station reported.\n\n\n\nBut there was a major hitch: Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on international child abduction. The international agreement standardizes laws, but only among participating countries.\n\n\n\nSo while Japanese civil law stresses that courts resolve custody issues based on the best interest of the children without regard to either parent's nationality, foreign parents have had little success in regaining custody.\n\n\n\nJapanese family law follows a tradition of sole custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children.\n\n\n\nIn court documents filed in May, Noriko Savoie denied that she was failing to abide by the terms of the couple's court-approved parenting plan or ignoring court-appointed parent coordinators. She added she was \"concerned about the stability of Father, his extreme antagonism towards Mother and the effect of this on the children.\"\n\n\n\nNoriko Savoie could not be reached by CNN for comment.\n\n\n\nBruno said he helped Christopher Savoie pursue legal remedies to recover the children, working with police, the FBI and the State Department.\n\n\n\n\"We tried to do what we could to get the kids back,\" Bruno said. \"There was not a whole lot we can do.\"\n\n\n\n\"Our court system failed him,\" said Diane Marshall, a court-appointed parent coordinator who helped Savoie make decisions about the children. \"It's just a mess.\"\n\n\n\nBut Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney, told CNN that the children's father had other legal options.\n\n\n\nThe International Association for Parent-Child Reunion, formed in Japan this year, claims to know of more than 100 cases of children abducted by non-custodial Japanese parents.\n\n\n\nAnd the U.S. State Department says it is not aware of a single case in which a child taken from the United States to Japan has been ordered returned by Japanese courts -- even when the left-behind parent has a U.S. custody decree.\n\n\n\nFacing such statistics and the possibility of never seeing his kids again, Savoie took matters into his own hands.\n\n\n\nHe flew to Fukuoka. And as his ex-wife walked the two children to school Monday morning, Savoie drove alongside them.\n\n\n\nHe grabbed the kids, forced them into his car, and drove off, said police in Fukuoka.  Watch CNN panel discuss Savoie's legal options \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe headed for the U.S. consulate in that city to try to obtain passports for Isaac and Rebecca.\n\n\n\nBut Japanese police, alerted by Savoie's ex-wife, were waiting.\n\n\n\nConsulate spokeswoman Tracy Taylor said she heard a scuffle outside the doors of the consulate. She ran up and saw a little girl and a man, whom police were trying to talk to.\n\n\n\nEventually, police took Savoie away, charging him with the abduction of minors -- a charge that carries a jail sentence of up to five years.\n\n\n\nBruno said if the situation were reversed and a Japanese parent had abducted a Japanese child and fled to America, U.S. courts would \"correct that problem, because it's a crime.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he has \"concerns about Japan ... providing a place for people to abduct children and go to. The parent left behind does not have recourse.\" He added, \"the president and his administration should do something to correct this.\"\n\n\n\nThe consulate met with Savoie on Monday and Tuesday, Taylor said. It has provided him with a list of local lawyers and said it will continue to assist.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the international diplomacy continues. During the first official talks between the United States and Japan's new government, the issue of parental abductions was raised.\n\n\n\nBut it is anybody's guess what happens next to Savoie, who sits in a jail cell.\n\n\n\nCNN's Kyung Lah in Tokyo, Japan, and Aaron Cooper, Saeed Ahmed and Carolina Sanchez in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"Hillbilly Handfishin'\" ", "answer_start": "1121"}], "question": "What can outdoorsy types catch up withq", "id": "510", "answers": [{"text": "\"Hillbilly Handfishin'\" ", "answer_start": "1121"}, {"text": "\"Hillbilly Handfishin'\" ", "answer_start": "1121"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "TNT is airing \"Bones\" all day starting at 10 a.m", "id": "906e1566e6177643b38e8528a96ef8a491NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "BET is catching you up with its newest", "id": "125affa937db218460c850593c00e817bbeNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Outdoorsy types can catch up with", "id": "6277791ccebb52f4c96a0c8e150c6b10994NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(EW.com) -- Spidey will cast his net across millions of TV screens during Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but that's not where Thursday's televisual treats end.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're a certified dude, a lady with a taste for the finer things, a procedural junkie, a spy fan, or someone who understands \"There's always money in the banana stand,\" we present a list of the all that's worth watching this Turkey Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun for the Whole Family\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you're slaving over your bird bright and early, give the kids a taste of what could await them if they don't toe the line with the Style Network's \"Supernanny\" marathon (6 a.m.-6 p.m.) Kids will also love back-to-back \"Tom & Jerry\" episodes on Cartoon Network (9 a.m.-7 p.m.), and teens will be occupied by MTV's double header of \"Friendzone\" (9 a.m.-1 p.m.) and \"Ridiculousness\" (3-7 p.m.).\n\n\n\n\n\nDudesgiving\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a plethora of guy-friendly fare on all day.

Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier.\n\n\n\nOn the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested.\n\n\n\nMohler told police he \"was aware of what was going on in Missouri,\" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\n\nFive members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an \"associate\" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said.\n\n\n\nThe six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims.\n\n\n\nPolice did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.\n\n\n\nDarrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.\n\n\n\nMore charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.\n\n\n\nAlumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.\n\n\n\nThe alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nSome lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.\n\n\n\nThe Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\nInvestigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday.

Albright is former U.S. secretary of state. William S. Cohen is former U.S. secretary of defense. They are co-chairs of the Genocide Prevention Task Force.\n\n\n\nMadeleine K. Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur.\n\n\n\nThis instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur.\n\n\n\nWith all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security?\n\n\n\nLast year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.)\n\n\n\nThe idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times.\n\n\n\nMany people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen?\n\n\n\nThere is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of \"ancient hatreds\" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared.\n\n\n\nOur report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities:\n\n\n\nFirst, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges.\n\n\n\nSecond is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action.\n\n\n\nEarly prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers.\n\n\n\nPreventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies.\n\n\n\nA willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat.\n\n\n\nLastly, we cite the power of international action. The United States has an interest in promoting a system of international norms and institutions that averts potential genocide and mass atrocities before they occur, stops them quickly and effectively when they occur, helps societies rebuild in their wake and holds perpetrators accountable. By working in partnership with others in the global community, the United States will multiply its positive impact.\n\n\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge. We understand that the next president will face many pressing international priorities, as well as real limitations of time and resources. But we believe that preventing genocide is possible, and that striving to do so is imperative, both for our national interests and for our leadership position in the world. Our report seeks to honor the memory of past victims of genocide and mass atrocities by encouraging future action.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Madeleine K. Albright and William S. Cohen.

The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick \"Crank High Voltage,\" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.\n\n\n\nOverall box office was up for the fourth straight weekend, surging 21 percent over this same weekend last year.

Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bb\n\nHe was held in federal custody over the weekend.\n\nAuthorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.\n\nCourt documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.\n\nHowever, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.\n\nThe entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.\n\nHarris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards.\n\nThe show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.\n\nAuthorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"\n\nAt his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.\n\n\"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n\"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"\n\nThe sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nThe bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.\n\nThe guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.\n\nHarris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.\n\nCourt documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation.\n\n\"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.\n\nHarris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as \"trap musik,\" the name of Harris' second album.

Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to \"al Qaeda,\" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut without the simultaneous presence of Malcolm X as a Muslim revolutionary, the Southern Baptist pacifism of Martin Luther King Jr. would not have been as formidable a force.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm X and Martin Luther King were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more than three decades now, I have taught generations of American students who come to college having scarce read a word about Malcolm X, and yet everything about Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil Americans come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a Muslim revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today, Islam and Muslims will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to American lives and liberties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans are Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, and anything else in between -- but Americans are also Muslims, millions of them, and Islam has now become integral to what the distinguished American sociologist Robert Bellah termed our \"civil religion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is only apt that this particular Thanksgiving, Americans think about Eid-ul-Adha, as precious to Muslim-Americans as the occasion that has gathered us all \"at the table.\" Let's make room for Muslims \"at the table\" because -- to quote Langston Hughes -- they \"too, sing America.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, ", "answer_start": "847"}], "question": "What do police say about it?", "id": "1823", "answers": [{"text": "person ", "answer_start": "689"}, {"text": "a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, ", "answer_start": "847"}, {"text": "One person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred ", "answer_start": "685"}, {"text": "12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles.

But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry.\n\n\n\nMcMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, \"For Laughing Out Loud.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me. ... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical. ...

They are not something one person does.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's \"Toy Story\" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other \"toys\" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent \"Are you a Mac or a PC,\" were uber-cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Jobs explained to the news program \"60 Minutes\" in 2003, when Lucas was creating \"Star Wars\" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, \"Toy Story,\" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Toy Story\" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other companies sold digital music before Apple,\" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. \"Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes. The ability of the iPod, and later the iPhone and iPad, to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks for allowing me to put my whole CD collection in my pocket,\" Sebastian Bach, ex-frontman of the heavy metal band Skid Row tweeted after news of Jobs' death was made public. \"You have made air travel a lot more fun among other things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation was not without some growing pains, however.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome industry insiders worried that digital downloads were negatively affecting sales of music and the issue of piracy became a hot one.

Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nHerds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.\n\nCold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped.\n\nThe beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note that the color isn't natural for pine trees.\n\n\"Come soon. It's happening quickly,\" he said.\n\nVisit in the summer or early fall and take a breathtaking drive to 12,183 feet, Patterson said. Or, come in the winter and enjoy snowshoeing and nearby skiing. Many of the park's 355 miles of hiking trails are open year-round.\n\nAlpine Glaciers, Switzerland\n\nThe European Alps sit at a lower altitude than the Rocky Mountains, and their glaciers and ski resorts are therefore more susceptible to melting, Henson said.\n\nA climate expert in Austria recently told National Geographic that the Alps' famed glaciers will disappear entirely between 2030 and 2050. A 2006 report had said they would melt by the end of the century.\n\nHenson said he once took a train through the Alpine glaciers. They're worth seeing before they go -- whenever that happens, he said.\n\n\"They're beautiful; the light blue quality of the meltwater is really stunning,\" he said.\n\nAmazon rain forest, Brazil\n\nDeforestation continues to be the major environmental issue in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest. But as locals and corporations chop down the Amazon's rich forests to create farmland and to harvest biofuels, climate change may make things worse.\n\n\"The fear is that there will be kind of a feedback where trees are cut down, and it gets warmer and drier\" in the forest until it can't grow back, Henson said.\n\nThe best way to visit the forest is by boat, Henson said. That way, you'll leave less of a mark on the struggling ecosystem.\n\nOf course, getting to a boat on the Amazon is not simple, and the long trip can create a lot of heat-trapping pollution. Henson said the destination might be one of those better left alone by tourists."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Transportation Security Administration ", "answer_start": "37"}], "question": "Who made passengers remove nipple rings?", "id": "993", "answers": [{"text": "Transportation Security Administration ", "answer_start": "37"}, {"text": "at a Texas ", "answer_start": "101"}, {"text": "airport ", "answer_start": "113"}, {"text": "officers ", "answer_start": "92"}, {"text": "officers ", "answer_start": "92"}], "validated_answers": "{\"92:101\": 1, \"37:76\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Agent using handheld metal detector at Lubbock airport found piercings", "id": "9915eb1502a0b4f55bdbeff7138064d56NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration said Friday its officers at a Texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed.\n\n\n\nThe woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby.

A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts.\n\n\n\nHamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.\n\n\n\n\"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,\" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. \"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.\"\n\n\n\nMore officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,\" Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them. She was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. Had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down, she would have chosen that option.\"\n\n\n\nShe eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said. One came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. She was handed a large pair, Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background,\" Allred said in the letter.\n\n\n\n\"Mandi Hamlin was publicly humiliated. ... Clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.\"  Watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry \u00bb\n\n\n\nAfterward, Hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. Hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, Allred said.\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't wish this experience upon anyone,\" Hamlin told reporters. \"I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared. No one deserves to go through this.\"\n\n\n\nIn a statement earlier Friday, the TSA said it \"is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body. Therefore, we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover.\"\n\n\n\nTSA included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a \"bra bomb\" in training and testing its officers.\n\n\n\nHamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted, and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed.\n\n\n\n\"People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment,\" Allred said. \"They should be respected just like everybody else.\"\n\n\n\nShe said she had received a call from TSA's public affairs office Friday morning. \"We hope that means they're going to jump on this and do something about it,\" she said. \"We want TSA to do the right thing now. We're going to give them the opportunity.\"\n\n\n\nHamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the Lubbock airport.

What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nSince 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector.\n\n\n\n\"When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nThat was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land.\n\n\n\nLock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent.\n\n\n\nWhen Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage.\n\n\n\n\"They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nSo Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted.\n\n\n\nWith the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: \"Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable.\"\n\n\n\nOn another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level.\n\n\n\nFreeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused\n\n\n\nFreeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house.\n\n\n\n\"One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFreeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal.\n\n\n\nBut Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed the farmers for the violence, saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land.\n\n\n\n\"Human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites, and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us, it didn't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights.\n\n\n\n\"And sometimes we say, good heavens, if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about, you better keep them away from us; we don't want to see them,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nBut it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire. They continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated. Some have even been killed.\n\n\n\nTractor driver William Kale said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted.\n\n\n\n\"They actually say you the workers, you are ones that are supporting the white farmer. That is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go,\" Kale told CNN.\n\n\n\nMany farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before.\n\n\n\nLock said: \"When ZANU-PF was in power, you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us. But now that these positions are being shared with Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC, Mr. Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program. And when it comes to the MDC, the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch. I have asked Mr. Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening.\"\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Tsvangirai refuted that. \"That is not true,\" he said. \"We initiated to find out who is being affected, the few remaining white farmers. Let's be frank here, we are talking of farmers as being white, but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture. There should be no disruption of any farm activity.\"\n\n\n\nTo those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Immigration Minister Eric Besson ", "answer_start": "277"}], "question": "Who says the man denied wife liberty of coming and going with face uncovered?", "id": "38", "answers": [{"text": "Immigration Minister Eric Besson ", "answer_start": "277"}, {"text": "France ", "answer_start": "23"}], "validated_answers": "{\"277:310\": 2, \"none\": 1}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is France scheduled to do?", "id": "659fd1dbbfab61e4df8a5d2093f0283d3e3NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "Paris, France (CNN) -- France has denied citizenship to a man because he allegedly forced his wife to wear a full Islamic veil, the French immigration minister said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man was applying for citizenship in order to join his French wife in France, Immigration Minister Eric Besson said. The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having \"good morality,\" Besson said.

It has among the most severe government restrictions on religion in Western Europe, as well as some of the highest levels of social tension involving religion, Pew senior researcher Brian Grim told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than half of French people support a full ban veils, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's despite government estimates that fewer than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about 6 percent of the population, according to Pew Forum research. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools.

He had been hearing blanks for many months of training.\n\n\n\nBut on November 5 at Fort Hood, he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend's head, seeing friends grabbing their arms, and blood just everywhere. It's a pretty hard thing to see,\" Burnette recalled.\n\n\n\n\"And not having any way to defend yourself.\"\n\n\n\nThe gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform, his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest. No one had reason to pay him heed, Burnette said.\n\n\n\nWhen the madness began, the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range. He just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision.\n\n\n\nHe reloaded. And fired. Reloaded. And fired again.\n\n\n\n\"He was very swift, very tactical,\" said Burnette, sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood, his left arm and hand bandaged.\n\n\n\nThe mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base. Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed; more than 40 others were wounded.\n\n\n\nFifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on Wednesday, four in intensive care, according to Fort Hood spokesman Col. James Rossi.\n\n\n\nThey were victims of a soldier who turned on his own, authorities say.\n\n\n\nBurnette saw the laser sights on the gunman's weapon. The shooter looked serious, intent. He screamed at the top of his lungs, \"Allahu akbar,\" which means 'God is great' in Arabic.\n\n\n\nBurnette dropped to the floor, hugging the ground for dear life. His mind was spinning. What insanity was this?\n\n\n\n\"Once I saw the blood, I realized I had to move,\" he said. \"I had to get out of there.\"\n\n\n\nBurnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction. He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter. He knew it would draw the gunman's attention and divert his line of sight from others.\n\n\n\nBurnette said he wasn't trying to play a hero.\n\n\n\n\"There are guys overseas doing more than what I did,\" he said. \"I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference.\"\n\n\n\nBut that's when he got hit. He took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen.\n\n\n\n\"After the hit, I fell down, not even realizing I had been hit,\" he said. \"As I tried to get back up, I was shot in the elbow on the left arm and ... the knuckle on the left pinky finger.\"\n\n\n\nHe was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter's aim.\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to kill all of us,\" Burnette said. \"We were all unarmed.\"\n\n\n\nBurnette's gut felt like a knife slicing through it. He couldn't feel his leg. His left arm was numb, too. He stared at it and thought of those dummy arms that people buy at Halloween.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my God,\" he thought. \"This guy shot me.\"\n\n\n\nBurnette began moving with every ounce of strength he could muster and hid in a nearby cubicle. The gunman had started moving to the other side of the building, reloading and shooting. Reloading and shooting.\n\n\n\nBurnette knew he had to get out of that building.\n\n\n\n\"As I started to run, I fell again, not realizing I couldn't use my left leg.\"\n\n\n\nAfter falling, Burnette said, he \"threw all of my body weight ... towards that door as hard and as fast as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\"Once I hit that front door, I began to low crawl, about five meters up a hill just, you know, pushing my body forward with everything I had,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door.\n\n\n\n\"Everything is going to be all right,\" the sergeant told him, as he began administering first aid. Burnette said he doesn't know the sergeant's name, but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again.\n\n\n\n\"Our Father who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name.\"\n\n\n\nBurnette, a practicing Catholic, lie on the ground, repeating the prayer over and over again. He didn't know whether he would see his wife again.\n\n\n\nA week later, Burnette has undergone two operations and still has a bullet lodged in his right hip. On Wednesday, he was making his way to the Army's Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment.\n\n\n\nHe knows that's where Maj.

They'll be getting some feature and style upgrades, as well as some price-slashing, in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the iPods were largely overshadowed by Tuesday's iPhone 4S news, Apple CEO Tim Cook also announced a handful of tweaks to Apple's iconic music-player line -- in plenty of time, of course, for the holiday shopping season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Touch, now the most popular iPod, will be available in both black and white and get a $30 price cut, to $199 for 8GB of storage, $299 for 32 gigs and $399 for 64.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also run Apple's new iOS5 operating system, meaning its ability to run apps, surf the Web and the like will maintain its unofficial status as the iPhone-without-a-phone. The new Touch ships on October 12.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nano, perhaps appropriately, is getting an even smaller update. The most fun change will be Apple's addition of 16 new clock faces for folks who use the tiny player's 1.5-inch screen as a watch. Our favorite? The iconic Mickey Mouse watch is now available, with Mickey's hands spinning around to tell the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also getting a price cut, down to $129 for the 8GB version and $149 for 16GB. The runt of the litter, the 2GB Nano, goes for a mere $49. (Virtually free by Apple's standards, if still more expensive than some rival mp3 players with the same limited storage space).\n\n\n\n\n\nTotally lost in the shuffle (see what we did there?) was any mention at all of the iPod Classic or ... Shuffle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two didn't get a single mention at Tuesday's event, just as they were left out in the cold at last year's iPod event.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's led to lots of stories in the tech press speculating that the clock is ticking toward the demise of the two venerable players.

It will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users' iPod, iPhone or other device. Each device will get 5GB of free storage, according to Cook.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with iTunes, the cloud-based service would let a user access their music, videos and the like from any Apple device running iOS5."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60, ", "answer_start": "1157"}], "question": "Where do visitors take up Jewish  tradition of leaving stones as  grave markers?", "id": "410", "answers": [{"text": "Section 60.

Marissa Alexander's office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on June 3, 2005.\n\n\n\nArlington's Section 60 is the final resting place for many casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nHer husband, Staff Sgt. Leroy Alexander, was half a world away fighting with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, but he had found a way to send a floral arrangement to his wife, who was five months pregnant with twins.\n\n\n\n\"He called me and asked me what building I worked in. He said he had to update some records,\" Alexander said. The flowers lifted her spirits.\n\n\n\nBut a few hours later, her emotions would be thrown into a tailspin. Alexander saw two Army officers in dress uniforms knock on her front door.\n\n\n\nOne of the officers started to talk: \"We regret to inform you...\"\n\n\n\nIf he said any more, Alexander doesn't remember. \"The next memory I have is in my kitchen, banging on the floor. I just couldn't believe it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe good feelings from flowers delivered a few hours before were gone, replaced by shock, pain and mourning.\n\n\n\nA roadside bomb had made her a widow.\n\n\n\nStaff Sgt. Alexander now lies in Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60, where 500 soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.\n\n\n\nFor years Section 60 has been the one of busiest parts of the cemetery. Every day new burials bring precision marches, the somber tones of taps and the nerve-rattling three-gun salutes.  Watch how widows connect at Section 60 \u00bb\n\n\n\nThen there are family and friends who come to the graves to make an emotional connection to their lost loved ones.\n\n\n\nMemorial Day weekend brings even more activity and more visitors. Adults, even some uniformed generals, walk slowly between the rows and rows of headstones, looking for a familiar name. But small children often seem to find the cemetery a place to explore, even play. Their smiles and curiosity remind grown-ups that even in a place synonymous with death, life goes on.\n\n\n\nA sense of community has emerged in Section 60.\n\n\n\n\"I've come here at times and I've met people who were paying remembrances to their loved ones. You become friendly,\" Capt. Alexander said. \"You see each other sometimes and you make a friendship because you know that your loved ones died for the same cause.\"\n\n\n\nAngie Capra's husband is buried a few yards from Leroy Alexander. Air Force Tech Sgt. Anthony Capra was an explosive ordnance disposal expert, killed trying disarm a bomb in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\"Other widows will come by and put something on there for me if they don't see me. They'll put down flowers. It's kind of a community,\" Capra said.\n\n\n\nMore than flowers adorn the graves in Section 60. Visitors of all faiths have picked up the ancient Jewish tradition of leaving a small stone on the headstones to show that a visitor had been to the grave. In most cases these are pebbles found near the grave. But some people have taken to leaving colored glass beads or elaborately painted stones with shamrocks or words like \"hero.\"  View images from Section 60 \u00bb\n\n\n\nCapra recently found a small Yoda figure on her husband's grave. She doesn't know who left it, but it must have been a friend, because her husband loved \"Star Wars.\"\n\n\n\n\"We never know who puts stuff\" on the headstone, she said.\n\n\n\nSome mementos leave one to wonder about the story behind them. Like the headstone topped by a tiny bottle of Tabasco hot sauce. Or a set of dog tags with a name that didn't match the name on the headstone.  Watch how friends say goodbye to a fallen soldier \u00bb\n\n\n\nThere is another topped by a small Lego toy, perhaps left by a child whose father died in a far-off land before they even knew each other. Or the grave adorned with an empty bottle of Bud Light, a rubber duck and a candle.\n\n\n\nNearby an empty Wild Turkey bottle is the lone addition to the grave of a soldier who died in a country where drinking alcohol is strictly forbidden.\n\n\n\nCapra has found a variety of items on Tony's headstone.\n\n\n\n\"Coins, lots of rocks, candy. My husband was a candy freak,\" Capra said. \"There was a cross. A little necklace, Mardi Gras beads during Mardi Gras season. Anything they have they'll put on top to show that they are thinking about them at the time.\"\n\n\n\nAlexander seems to draw strength from the items she finds.\n\n\n\n\"Someone came and did a picture of Lee, and it was a hand-drawn picture. I thought that was very interesting,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"People who haven't been seen in years will leave a note of some sort. It's nice to know that you've been remembered after all of this time. To know that we have friends who still love and support us, that is just wonderful.\"\n\n\n\nSection 60 has been called the \"saddest acre in America,\" and without a doubt sadness abounds. But so do comfort, support and even an occasional smile."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "partying ", "answer_start": "717"}], "question": "What was Michael Phelps seen doing in NY?", "id": "303", "answers": [{"text": "smoking ", "answer_start": "856"}, {"text": "partying ", "answer_start": "717"}, {"text": "bong smoking ", "answer_start": "851"}], "validated_answers": "{\"851:864\": 1, \"717:726\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what team does he play for?", "id": "153223a01a3530541cb89e49e1ebc37db84NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "when Michael Phelps reportedly seen partying at NY bar?", "id": "180bcb9767279384ef9a2800aec75296d82NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "where Phelps apologized in January after photo shows him smoking from bong?", "id": "324df24944b2ce3481f8cddf886c06d1f0cNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What was the gossip?", "id": "48471d1030a105b45bf8747d31c00941e92NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what did Phelps do?", "id": "4907fb2a440dabd473090415fe06f189d85NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What reason did Phelps apologize in January?", "id": "756823a9e84a39c40e99b1a53d92fad5cdfNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Debbie Phelps, the mother of swimming star Michael Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing, is the author of a new memoir, \"A Mother For All Seasons.\"\n\n\n\nDebbie Phelps, mother of Olympian Michael Phelps, tells Larry King her son has strong values.\n\n\n\nPhelps spoke with CNN's Larry King about her new book, a recent tabloid report detailing her son's partying ways and the infamous bong photo.\n\n\n\nThe following is an edited version of the transcript.\n\n\n\nLarry King: You have this terrific new book coming.

When the DJ started playing MIA's 'Paper Planes,' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling 'shots.' Phelps definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round. He ordered four bottles of Vodka.\"\n\n\n\nIs this tough for a mother? How do you react?\n\n\n\nDebbie Phelps: It's one thing that I learn at a very early age is I don't get caught up in gossip columns. I know my son. He has great values, lots of integrity. That's what I think about that.\n\n\n\nKing: Did you talk to him about this?\n\n\n\nPhelps: I always talk to Michael. I talk to Michael every day. We talked about training today and things of that nature.\n\n\n\nKing: But it would be normal to say, what happened, wouldn't it? I would say that to my son.\n\n\n\nPhelps: We give support. We give guidance. We give an ear to listen. And, again, I don't get caught up in gossip.\n\n\n\nKing: Therefore, you don't believe it? I just want to establish what your feelings are.\n\n\n\nPhelps: I don't get caught up in gossip, Mr. King.\n\n\n\nKing: What about something that wasn't gossip, the picture with the bong thing. It was a picture.\n\n\n\nPhelps: It's a picture, that's true. But, you know, a picture can say many things. It has many words. It has many meanings. It has many visualizations that you want to think. It depends on the person who is looking at that picture.\n\n\n\nYou know, as a mom, I support all three of my children. I believe that no matter who you are in this country, in this world, there are obstacles that get into your life. I call them speed bumps in school sometimes. I heard someone say lightning bolts. That's another term for that.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, how do we grow? How do we learn? You raise a child through 18. You send them off to college. You give them the roots. You give them the foundation to be a strong, young man, a strong lady. Life throws curve balls to you sometimes. How do you handle that curve ball?\n\n\n\nKing: Michael is 23. That's an adult. He's an adult.\n\n\n\nPhelps: A young adult.\n\n\n\nKing: Young adult. So one could say it's his life. He chooses to lead it. As our parent, we do our best to guide them, but 23 is 23. Do you view him still as a kid?\n\n\n\nPhelps: I view my 31-year-old daughter as a kid sometimes. You know, I look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves. They have many strong values, strong points, professionalism. I'm just very proud of all three of them and everything they've done.\n\n\n\nKing: Do you think these kind of stories -- and you don't pay attention to them -- hurt your book?\n\n\n\nPhelps: I was asked many times and told many times, \"Debbie, you need to write a book some day.\" As an educator, I'm thinking, I would really like to do that. It became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book, not knowing exactly what it was going to be.\n\n\n\nWas it going to be my life? Was it going to be parenting? Was it going to be swimming? Was it just going to be motivational and inspirational? When I take a look at the book I was able to write, I have great pride in that book because it shows other people, every woman, but not even women -- men can read this book also -- the inspiration and motivation of life.\n\n\n\nKing: The question is, \"Do you think these kind of stories might hurt the chance of people buying the book, which is what you want?\"\n\n\n\nPhelps: People are going to have to make that decision.\n\n\n\nKing: Do you think it might?\n\n\n\nPhelps: Life is life. I do want to say, though, in reference to the Beijing Olympics, we, as a family, I think, made a great impression on the world, on the United States. My son has great love for me. It's a great bonding relationship. Families are very important.\n\n\n\nKing: Is he still a role model, do you think?\n\n\n\nPhelps: You know, when I think of the word role model, I'll go back to me being a little girl. It was my mom and my dad. They were my role models when I was growing up. When I hear that role model in a sentence with my son, what I think about with Michael is what he does with and for children. It might be things people don't even know of -- his association with the Boys and Girls Club. For years, he has done that (and) his association with Make A Wish.\n\n\n\nHe touches kids' lives. So if an individual, wherever they may be, may select my son as a role model, I say that my son has strong values. I say he's a human being. And I say that from obstacles that get in people's ways -- we all have them, Mr. King, and you know that -- what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion?"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "ancestry for the first time ", "answer_start": "106"}], "question": "What did the Californian convert to Islam do in al Qaeda video?", "id": "37", "answers": [{"text": "ancestry for the first time ", "answer_start": "106"}, {"text": "makes reference ", "answer_start": "76"}, {"text": "his Jewish ", "answer_start": "95"}, {"text": "ancestry for the first time ", "answer_start": "106"}, {"text": "a ", "answer_start": "12"}, {"text": "in an official ", "answer_start": "134"}, {"text": "new ", "answer_start": "14"}, {"text": "message.\n", "answer_start": "158"}, {"text": "anti-Israel, anti-U.S. ", "answer_start": "18"}, {"text": "an American ", "answer_start": "48"}, {"text": "member makes reference ", "answer_start": "69"}, {"text": "his Jewish ", "answer_start": "95"}, {"text": "In ", "answer_start": "9"}, {"text": "\"Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry, the last of whom was his grandfather,\" he says.\n", "answer_start": "739"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What does the person think of his American citizenship?", "id": "59da651453d44942e89c7ab472457a082fNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What did the speaker say about Gadahn's American citizenship?", "id": "488dab1ada437464d8b852bcc0552e1e3f2NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- In a new anti-Israel, anti-U.S. video, an American al Qaeda member makes reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message.\n\n\n\nAdam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is seen in an earlier al Qaeda video.\n\n\n\nIn the video, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, discusses his roots as he castigates U.S. policies and deplores Israel's offensive in Gaza that started in late December 2008 and continued into January.\n\n\n\n\"Let me here tell you something about myself and my biography, in which there is a benefit and a lesson,\" Gadahn says, as he elicits support from his fellow Muslims for \"our weapons, funds and Jihad against the Jews and their allies everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry, the last of whom was his grandfather,\" he says.\n\n\n\nGrowing up in rural California, Gadahn embraced Islam in the mid-1990s, moved to Pakistan and has appeared in al Qaeda videos before.\n\n\n\nHe was indicted in the United States in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al Qaeda, according to the FBI.

have no morals, no mercy, no humanity and indeed, no honor?\" he says in reference to Zionists and Israel.\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of America, the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the world?\"\n\n\n\nMansfield thinks the video may have been made between late April and mid-May, before President Obama's speech in Cairo, Egypt, addressing U.S. relations with Muslims.\n\n\n\nGadahn notes Obama's inauguration, Netanyahu's election in February, and Obama's speech in Turkey in April.\n\n\n\nSpecifically mentioning the Gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Somalia, where the \"Zio-Crusader alliance\" is fighting his \"brothers,\" he says \"this open-faced aggression\"

prisoner in Israel, who is hailed as a hero by Hezbollah.\n\n\n\nKuntar was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an Israeli man in front of his 4-year-old daughter before smashing her head against a rock  and tossing her into the sea.\n\n\n\nThe victim's 2-year-old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother, who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the

David the previous year.\n\n\n\nKuntar is one of five Lebanese prisoners who Israel will release in exchange for two Israeli soldiers, Ehud \"Udi\" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.\n\n\n\nThe Lebanon-based Shiite militant group kindapped the two in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel that left three other Israeli soldiers dead.\n\n\n\nHezbollah never gave Israel any indication whether they survived

navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986.\n\n\n\n\"We have an obligation, a moral obligation to their families to bring finality,\" Regev said. \"That if they are in fact no longer living, that their families can have a funeral, that they can have a grave, that they can know that this is over.\"\n\n\n\nIsrael has repeatedly attempted to get information about Arad and other missing airmen by using Lebanese detainees as leverage.\n\n\n\nFormer Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised the Arad family that Kuntar will not be released unless

So when he wants to slow down, he heads to his hometown of Columbia, Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grew up in Columbia and couldn't wait to get out of town, but after living in North Carolina for three years, he was ready to come back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I realized after being away, there just aren't many places cooler than this,\" Edwards said. \"So I moved back, and now I live here and I'm really proud to live here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe competes in both the Nationwide Series and the Sprint Cup Series for NASCAR. He won a Busch Series Cup in 2007, finished last year's Sprint Cup Series in second, and is fiercely fighting for Sprint Cup honors this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwards has recovered from a frightening crash-ending to his last race in Talladega, Alabama, and is looking forward to racing in Richmond, Virginia, this week, hoping for his first trip of the season to victory lane. His fans are eagerly awaiting that trademark victory back flip. But through all of the excitement and acclaim, Edwards remains grounded and true to his Missouri roots.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe took CNN home with him to Columbia -- which is between Kansas City and St. Louis -- to share some of his favorite spots.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day started at Rock Bridge State Park, 2,273 acres of natural beauty and serenity that is hard to believe is only 10 minutes from the bustling center of this college town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This park is one of Columbia's best secrets. It's a beautiful place to come mountain biking, hiking. There's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Edwards gets the need for speed at home, he opts for two wheels instead of four. He grabs his bicycle and heads to the Katy Trail, just up the road from Rock Bridge Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This used to be an old railroad, and now it's a state park. It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwards also showed us one of his favorite trail features: a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by Missouri natives as \"the big bur oak.\" Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite, and Edwards has two favorite places to cure that. For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school. We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only thing flipping in here is the burgers,\" Kurry said. Booches has been in operation in Columbia since 1884.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up is Shakespeare's Pizza, which has been serving slices in Columbia for more than 35 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can make you anything you want. They've got whole wheat crust if you're into the health stuff like I am. And it's so good, they even catered my wedding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are museums, festivals and parades, and the University of Missouri has provided a lot of athletic excitement with its football and basketball teams over the past few years. It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities.

I like you to be with me, but this is your decision.' \"\n\n\n\nSo father and son went their separate ways.\n\n\n\nBut there has been no running from the bin Laden name, not after the events of September 11. On that day, Omar bin Laden was in Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from.\n\n\n\nAsked if, upon learning of the news, he knew his father had been behind it, he replied, \"Yeah, maybe.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he felt sadness for those killed. \"I don't think 9/11 was right personally,\" he said. \"I don't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying.\"\n\n\n\nAsked why he did not protest more strongly his father's role in the killing of civilians, he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell Osama bin Laden to change tactics in the name of Islam.\n\n\n\nAnd even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur, he said, al Qaeda would not stop. \"My father doesn't have the power to stop the movement at this moment.\"\n\n\n\nSitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife, Zaina. The two are organizing a multi-month horserace through North Africa in the name of peace, set to kick off this year.\n\n\n\nBut getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin Laden has been difficult. \"It would probably have been easier to do a race without having Omar's name, but then the race would just be a race, it wouldn't be a race for peace,\" his wife said.\n\n\n\nOmar bin Laden said his relationship with his father was limited. He is the fourth of 11 children born to his father's first wife, and he is one of 19 children Osama bin Laden has fathered. \"Most of the time he busy, so busy, all the day he's busy [with] his friends. He was working a lot.\"\n\n\n\nOmar bin Laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task: trying to rebrand the name they share.\n\n\n\nBut he said he is not looking for approval from his father. \"My life, I take care of my life,\" he said. \"My father he take care of his life.\" E-mail to a friend"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "some of the most gigantic pumpkins in the world, ", "answer_start": "273"}], "question": "what did the doodle show", "id": "304", "answers": [{"text": "some of the most gigantic pumpkins in the world, ", "answer_start": "273"}], "validated_answers": "{\"273:322\": 2, \"none\": 1}"}], "context": "(Mashable) -- You know there's something significant going on when Google creates one of its whimsical \"doodles\" on its home page, and Halloween is no exception.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you can't see it where you are, this year (in some countries), there's a time-lapse video showing some of the most gigantic pumpkins in the world, going through a metamorphosis from blobs of orange to art as night falls.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's how the Googlers describe the making of this kooky video on the official Google blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To celebrate Halloween this year, the doodle team wanted to capture that fascinating transformation that takes place when carving a pumpkin.

Direct. In control. Loyal.\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford.\n\n\n\nThat's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina.\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband.\n\n\n\nA reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated.\n\n\n\n\"I'm here, and she's there,\" he replied.\n\n\n\nAs romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends.\n\n\n\n\"Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,\" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP.\n\n\n\n\"She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,\" Mosteller continued. \"She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children.\"\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\n\n\"When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,\" she wrote. \"We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\"This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure.\"\n\n\n\nMosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to \"Maria\" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her \"tan lines\" and \"gentle kisses.\"\n\n\n\nThe e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity.\n\n\n\n\"[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,\" Mosteller said. \"To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us.\"\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994.\n\n\n\n\"Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot. That was the opinion of most people,\" Mosteller said. \"But she and Mark worked together and turned that thing around so that candidate three, four and five ended up throwing their support behind him, and he won.\"\n\n\n\nThe two are equals intellectually, according to people who know them.\n\n\n\nShe went on to manage his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, turning her home into campaign headquarters.\n\n\n\nJenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents.\n\n\n\nShe also took a $70,000 deficit from the operations of the governor's mansion and put its finances into the black.\n\n\n\n\"I pretty much am in his office in the mornings most days, and I do pretty much anything he wants me to do for him. I help to bridge the gap between things that have been commonplace themes in his life and make sure everybody in the office is on pace with his agenda,\" Jenny Sanford told Charleston's Post and Courier in June 2005.\n\n\n\nThe governor told the newspaper that his wife is \"particularly good with financial analysis [and] working with numbers.\"\n\n\n\nShe took up health as a key issue in her role as first lady, advocating nutrition, exercise and cancer prevention, serving on major boards and speaking at various functions to raise funds for disease research.\n\n\n\n\"This is a classy woman who lacks pretension,\" Mosteller said. \"I took a road trip with her last year, and she just automatically got into the back seat. When we were making a lot of appearances, and the schedules were hectic, she called and said, 'I've figured out that the key is changing your deodorant.'\n\n\n\n\"Jenny is someone you can talk politics with, you can talk about grand issues with, and you can also discuss deodorant,\" Mosteller said. \"She's a remarkable, classy woman with a lot of integrity who is trying to keep it together.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Gov.

(Yes, Simon, a cruise ship.) \"I think that this is a cruise ship like no other,\" she said of the K-Love Family and Friends cruise, a gathering of Christian music bands and their fans.\n\n\n\nShe beamed with pride then as she described her new exercise regimen and diet. The most difficult part has been to retrain her mind to turn to God instead of turning to food, she said.

She thinks her critics were too focused on her statements about not agreeing with what she calls \"the lifestyle\" and missed her message of love for everyone.\n\n\n\n\"I think that we are called to love people that are different from us and that don't agree with the things we agree with,\" she said.\n\n\n\nShe still watches \"American Idol\" faithfully, and like many other people tuning in each week, is a fan of Danny Gokey, a 28-year-old widower from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nShe said this week that he is the clear favorite but also likes 23-year-old Matt Giraud from Kalamazoo, Michigan (\"I love his voice\") and Lil Rounds, a mother of three from Memphis, Tennessee (\"I think she's incredible as well\").\n\n\n\n\"But I am still rooting for Danny to win,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAfter being booted from \"Idol,\" many observers thought that Mandisa had a good chance of becoming a successful R&B artist. She said she considered that path; it was all she wanted to be when she was growing up.

Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants.\n\n\n\nDavidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service.\n\n\n\nWhile some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services.\n\n\n\nWhile the cost of these \"free\" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of:\n\n\n\n1. Free laundry\n\n\n\nNothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.\n\n\n\nSince 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.\n\n\n\nThe laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.\n\n\n\nAs if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges\n\n\n\n2. Free skiing\n\n\n\nMichigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.\n\n\n\n3. Free computers\n\n\n\nAt my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered\n\n\n\n4. Free theater tickets\n\n\n\nNothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds.\n\n\n\nTicket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as little as $12 and into Mets games for just $3. Of course, the way those teams have played in the last year or so, that offer might scare off more prospective students than it entices.\n\n\n\n5. Personalized birthday cakes\n\n\n\nCollege birthdays are often all sorts of debauched fun, but at least in my experience, they were often sorely lacking in quality cake. Sure, sometimes you'd get a pan full of Betty Crocker-ed good intentions cooked in a dorm oven, which are precisely calibrated to burn cakes' edges while leaving the center liquid, but it was rare to see a real birthday cake.\n\n\n\nOhio University's dining services can fix that, though, by allowing students' parents to join the Birthday Club. For $18, parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates, napkins, and forks they'll need to share it with their friends.\n\n\n\n6. Cheap golf\n\n\n\nCollege students who want to golf on a tight budget often have to resign themselves to finding the rattiest municipal course they can find and hoping they survive the ordeal. Students at Stanford, though, have access to the Stanford Golf Course, a legendary course that's hosted such greats as Tom Watson and Tiger Woods since it opened in 1930.\n\n\n\nOnly students, alumni, faculty, and their guests can enjoy the course's picturesque views of San Francisco, and for guests the price is pretty steep, up to $110 a round. Students, though, get a great deal on greens fees; they can get in a full round for just $25.

Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert  to call the tip line at (843) 524-2777. Police also are seeking help from anyone who saw the Calverts' 2006 Mercedes Benz E320, Georgia Tech license plate GT821B on or about March 3, 2008."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "14 to 17.

We had a champagne breakfast to celebrate.\"\n\nHenry was the oldest tuatara ever to mate at the museum, on New Zealand's South Island, Hazley said.\n\nTuataras are the only living descendants of an order, related to dinosaurs, that flourished 200 million years ago. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species.\n\nBut it didn't come easy.\n\nUntil about six years ago, Henry was a nasty, irritable fellow who showed no interest in mating and would attack females when they were introduced. Hazley, who has been breeding tuataras for the past 35 years, eventually had to put him in \"solitary confinement.\"\n\nBut in 2002, veterinarians discovered that a lump in Henry's nether regions was a cancerous tumor. They removed it and, over the next few years, his mood -- and interest in the ladies -- improved.\n\nNow, Henry lives peacefully with Mildred and two other females. Breeders are hoping he'll show interest in Lucy, who is about the same age as Mildred, later this year. Female tuataras only lay eggs every two or three years, so Mildred likely won't be interested.  Watch a curator take care of the reproducing dinosaur kin \u00bb\n\nHenry's newfound libido does have some limits, however. Hazley said Juliet, a youthful 22 year old, appears to be too hot to handle for the centenarian -- who could live to be 200 years old if he stays healthy.\n\n\"I think he's a bit shy to mate with such a young woman,\" Hazley said. \"After a bit of experience with Mildred and Lucy, maybe he'll be interested in Juliet next year.\"\n\nMaxing out at about two-and-a-half feet long, tuataras are much smaller than their ancestors.\n\nThe word \"tuatara\" is derived from a Maori word meaning \"spiny back.\" In Maori legend, they are messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five-cent coin that was phased out in 2006.\n\nIt's been a baby boom at Southland Museum lately. Hazley said another 10 babies were born to another couple recently -- swelling the ranks of the 50 or so tuataras that were already there.\n\nFriday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet.

But Obama did not win the White House on hype, any more than he won it on hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant. He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama. He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game. And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning points\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels. He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that. Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity, epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debates: Obama won all three debates in the eyes of the public, polling for CNN suggested, even if he came up with few, if any, memorable promises or knockout blows. The debates showed the classic Obama -- thoughtful, deliberate and steady. Critically, Obama made no gaffes, rounding out a campaign that was remarkably free of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama may have looked an unlikely candidate and an even unlikelier victor only a year ago. But his campaign had a different look. It started small but with big ideas and worked, inexorably, to make them reality. Like any candidate, Obama faced challenges, but he always seemed to take the path that would make him stronger. And, by the end, the campaign and the support was so large, so well organized and so powerful that nothing could prevent Obama's march to victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Richard Allen Greene, Rebecca Sinderbrand and Laura Haring contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.\n", "answer_start": "104"}], "question": "What the police investigating?", "id": "784", "answers": [{"text": "[the alleged kidnapping] ", "answer_start": "821"}, {"text": "investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.\n", "answer_start": "104"}, {"text": "allegations by a former ", "answer_start": "80"}], "validated_answers": "{\"104:265\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What reason was he tortured?", "id": "370c364683e9d944c6593c93f5be74e02b5NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What evidence found?", "id": "456bc6926640cfa45ef85a80c508242cbd8NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "When the trial will be made?", "id": "6280418bf3af3304947a49288a8d9fa9a03NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "How many there are in the research involved?", "id": "650d70147bc9f6945f89d75e1d7cc81e87fNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.\n\n\n\nClaudio Lifschitz shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back.\n\n\n\nClaudio Lifschitz, 43, said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on Friday night and put a plastic bag over his head.\n\n\n\nThey then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, he said.\n\n\n\nEighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II.\n\n\n\n\"The police are investigating [the alleged kidnapping] as we speak,\" said Miguel Ambrosio, legal secretary in the office of federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. \"Once the judge heard the details of the alleged incident, he ordered an investigation to the police via telephone.\"\n\n\n\nLifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.\n\n\n\n\"I heard the noise of a blowtorch, and that's when the worst started, and I started to feel a burn on my left arm, and I could smell my hair on my arm burning,\" Lifschitz told CNN. \"Then I felt them slicing my back with a knife.\"\n\n\n\nImages of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters 'AMIA' had been scratched.\n\n\n\nThe assailants also carved numbers into his arm; the significance of the digits is unclear.

I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.\n\nThe country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious.

But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.\n\nTehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.\n\nAnd yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.\n\nI asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"\n\nI asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"\n\nMy guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"\n\nEvery film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then. It's ancient history to our young guide.\n\nWith our work done, we hurried to catch our flight home. As we crawled through Tehran's traffic, our driver cursed, \"Death to traffic.\"\n\nShocked, I said, \"What? I thought it was death to America.\"\n\nHe said, \"Here in Iran, when something frustrates us and is out of our control, we say 'death' to that.\"\n\nThen I thought, when people in my society say, \"Damn those teenagers,\" they don't mean they wish them to die and burn in hell for eternity ... they just want the kids to turn down the music.\n\nBoarding our plane, the Air France flight attendants -- so stylish with hair flowing freely -- seemed to welcome us as if onto a life raft. Women pulled off their scarves, wine was poured, and we flew west with the raw footage of a program we hoped would humanize a proud country of 70 million people.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

Tim Pawlenty.\n\n\n\nHer sentence stems from her involvement in the 1975 attempted bombings of two police cars and the slaying of Myrna Opsahl during a bank robbery that same year.\n\n\n\nBack then, Olson went by her birth name, Kathleen Anne Soliah. After her 1976 indictment in the attempted bombings, she changed her name and started a new life in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was not apprehended until 1999.\n\n\n\n\"I've really got nothing to say. She did her time, as minimal as that may have been,\" said Jon Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother was killed. \"One of those years -- just one -- was for the murder of my mom and the bank robbery up in Carmichael.\"\n\n\n\nMyrna Opsahl, a mother of four, was depositing money at the Crocker National Bank for her church when she was shot by Olson's co-defendant Emily Montague Harris, according to court documents. Harris was sentenced to eight years; she served four and was released on parole in February 2007.\n\n\n\nJon Opsahl, now 49, said he never understood why it took so long to bring his mother's killers to justice. While charges were filed in the bombings within months, no charges were brought in his mother's murder until 2002.\n\n\n\n\"You expect thugs to do what thugs do, but you don't expect the district attorney to turn a blind eye to the murder of an upstanding citizen,\" Jon Opsahl said Monday.\n\n\n\nOlson's release Tuesday will cap an oft-strange storyline that spans more than three decades and which saw Olson wear the hats of college student, 1970s radical, housewife and philanthropist.\n\n\n\nAttorney Andy Dawkins met Olson, now 62, shortly after she moved to St. Paul through friends in the reggae band, Pressure Drop. Fred Peterson, Olson's husband, played trumpet in the band, Dawkins said.\n\n\n\n\"She did good deeds everywhere. She raised three wonderful daughters. It was always a shock to all of us that the Sara we know had that past,\" Dawkins said.\n\n\n\nAfter attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, Olson moved to Berkeley in the early 1970s. There, she met Angela Atwood in 1972, and the two became best friends and roommates, Olson told L.A. Weekly in a 2002 interview shortly before she was imprisoned.\n\n\n\nAfter Atwood and five other SLA members were killed in a 1974 gunfight with the Los Angeles Police Department, Olson appeared at a memorial in Berkeley's Ho Chi Minh Park to eulogize her friend.\n\n\n\n\"SLA soldiers, although I know it's not necessary to say, keep fighting. I'm with you, and we are with you,\" Olson told the crowd.\n\n\n\nAlmost a year later, Olson took part in two bank robberies to help fund the SLA, according to court documents. During the Carmichael robbery, Olson \"entered the bank with a firearm and kicked a nonresisting pregnant teller in the stomach. The teller miscarried after the robbery,\" the documents said.\n\n\n\nIn August 1975, Los Angeles police found homemade bombs under two squad cars. They were designed to explode when the car moved, but neither device detonated.\n\n\n\nAuthorities cast the attempted bombings as payback for the bloody shootout that left Atwood and other SLA members dead.\n\n\n\nA probe into the gunbattle helped police arrest Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who claimed she had been kidnapped, raped and brainwashed by the SLA.\n\n\n\nIn her book \"Every Secret Thing,\" Hearst put Olson at the center of the Carmichael robbery.\n\n\n\nOlson soon left California. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, \"she evaded capture for 23 years, and in the meantime, became a doctor's wife, mother of three, community volunteer, veteran of charity work in Africa and practicing Methodist living in an upscale neighborhood in St. Paul.\"\n\n\n\nThough authorities said a 1999 \"America's Most Wanted\" episode marking the 25th anniversary of the L.A. shootout led to Olson's arrest, the show's Web site mentions neither Olson nor Soliah among its almost 1,100 \"captures.\"\n\n\n\nHer Minnesota friends and neighbors were shocked, even incredulous, when she was arrested. They pleaded with a judge to grant her bail. The Sara Olson Defense Fund began selling cookbooks, titled, \"Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes.\"\n\n\n\nIt would help that Olson was generous with her time. She was active in the church. She volunteered for political campaigns. Dawkins said he had a blind client to whom she used to read The New York Times.\n\n\n\nOlson's philanthropy, coupled with the connections of her husband, a respected emergency room doctor, made raising the $1 million bail relatively easy, said Dawkins, who remembers that some members of the community had so much faith in Olson they put up their children's college funds.\n\n\n\nOn October 31, 2001, Olson pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to ignite a destructive device or explosive.\n\n\n\nShe later tried to rescind the plea, saying \"cowardice\" prevented her from telling the truth. A superior court judge, however, denied her request and in January 2002 sentenced her to 20 years to life in prison, a sentence the parole board later reduced.\n\n\n\nOlson was charged with Opsahl's slaying that same week and pleaded guilty in 2003 to second-degree murder. Olson received a sentence of five years to life.\n\n\n\nThe California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement that Olson's sentence was reduced for good behavior and for her work on a maintenance crew that cleaned the main yard of the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla.\n\n\n\nDawkins said \"it's right\" that Olson served time, but he is glad she is being released. He expects many hugs await her in St. Paul and that she will soon be back to her generous ways.\n\n\n\n\"I really believe who we knew in St. Paul was the true Sara Olson,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Protection League disagrees and has loudly opposed her early release. Sgt. Paul Weber, the league's chief, called her a sociopath who \"never said she was sorry.\" He also lashed out at those who rush to defend her.\n\n\n\n\"Enough with the BS that she was unfairly targeted by law enforcement for her youthful indiscretions -- she is a criminal,\" Weber said in a Monday statement.\n\n\n\nCorrections officials say it's important that she be reunited with her family during her parole -- it helps reduce recidivism -- but Minnesota legislators, the governor and the St. Paul Police Federation have asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep her in California over the next year.\n\n\n\n\"Letting a domestic terrorist like Kathleen Soliah set the terms of her parole is an insult to the memory of Myrna Opsahl and all the men and women of LAPD past and present,\" the St. Paul union said in a letter last week.\n\n\n\nJon Opsahl, however, just wants to put Olson out of his mind.\n\n\n\n\"Get her out of here,\" he said. \"I don't want to see or think about her again.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "capital murder and three counts of attempted ", "answer_start": "1074"}], "question": "Bishop was charged with what?", "id": "438", "answers": [{"text": "shooting her colleagues ", "answer_start": "85"}, {"text": "capital murder and three counts of attempted ", "answer_start": "1074"}, {"text": "capital murder and three counts of attempted murder ", "answer_start": "1074"}], "validated_answers": "{\"1074:1119\": 2}"}], "context": "(CNN) -- The defense attorney appointed to represent an Alabama professor accused of shooting her colleagues said Friday he regrets describing her as \"wacko.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at a news conference, Roy Miller said \"something's wrong with this lady.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said his client, Amy Bishop, is \"aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, \"I just think the case speaks for itself.\" He added, \"I think she's wacko.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Friday's news conference, he referred to that remark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good lord, y'all,\" Miller said. \"Listen, I went overboard with that.

A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nA university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller said his client is \"trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,\" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology \"have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people.\" He said Bishop sometimes is \"so focused on the mental basis\" that she \"does not know what's going on around her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of \"wanton and reckless conduct\" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered \"a dozen subjects\" in the attempted bombing, but \"there were never any suspects.

They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\" Klein tells PEOPLE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy.

To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, becoming parents is what means the most. \"We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,\" she says. \"We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption.

I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition.\n\n\n\nOn the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, \"Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?\" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by.\n\n\n\nThey brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, \"OK, you're the guy.\" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away.\n\n\n\nCNN: How did you keep it light on the set?\n\n\n\nMears: Believe it or not, all the actors ... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to.\n\n\n\nCNN: Had you seen any of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movies?\n\n\n\nMears: Oh yeah. I mean, I'm a fan. I consider myself a fan of the series.\n\n\n\nI already knew all of the originals. I had them all on DVD, and when I first met with Platinum Dunes [the production company behind the new movie], I told them, \"Hey look, I'm a fan of the series first and foremost. If I'm right for the part, fantastic. If I'm not right for the part, that's OK, too. I, just as a fan, want to see a good 'Friday the 13th' film. I want to see the series continue so if I can help it, awesome, but I just want to see something good.\"\n\n\n\nCNN: Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons, or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own?\n\n\n\nMears: Definitely make it my own.\n\n\n\nI used the script that Mark Swift and Damian Shannon wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where I knew the other guys who've played \"Jason\" before, and what they've done, but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script.\n\n\n\nAnd there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before.\n\n\n\nCNN: It's kind of a dream come true.\n\n\n\nMears: Yeah, that's why I keep saying the words this whole interview like \"unbelievable,\" unbelievable because I don't believe it.\n\n\n\nCNN: Which is funny.

The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students.\n\n\n\n\"I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,\" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman.\n\n\n\nIn other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away \"for hours at a time,\" Miller said.\n\n\n\n\"What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,\" he said. \"The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations.\"\n\n\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having \"special needs\" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.\n\n\n\nOnly five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.\n\n\n\nSome of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.\n\n\n\nState investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to \"shut up.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle.\n\n\n\n\"It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,\" Joshua Peck said. \"He couldn't tell.\"\n\n\n\nAnd Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, \"He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\"I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?' Was he thinking, 'Why is my mom letting this person do this to me? Why am I here? I trust no one now.' \"\n\n\n\nIn Garrett's case, like others cited by the GAO, the teacher remains on the job. And what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply don't actually work.\n\n\n\nAt one school in Pennsylvania, however, teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods.\n\n\n\nThe Centennial School at Lehigh University serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school, and even from juvenile justice centers. When school director Michael George came to Centennial in 1999, the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year. After the school revamped its approach, no such incidents were reported.\n\n\n\nWhen they get to Centennial, students can be violent and aggressive. But instead of trying to force a change in behavior, the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways.\n\n\n\nChildren who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so, then re-directed to the task at hand. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves.\n\n\n\nAnd when a child acts violently, the staff is trained to step aside, rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint. On a recent visit to the school, all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers.\n\n\n\nThe school's philosophy can be summed up in a question George likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there: Which teacher you remember most from your own childhood?\n\n\n\n\"No one ever mentions the person who yelled at them, who screamed at them, who told them to write a phrase a hundred times, who slammed them into closets, who was abrupt, who made them feel stupid. No one ever mentions those people,\" said George.\n\n\n\n\"Our job is to teach. Sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges; it can be very, very difficult. But that's the job we chose to do.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "in Illinois. ", "answer_start": "1156"}], "question": "where Gov.

The nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court, must approve Zelaya's return to power.\n\n\n\nThe reconciliation government would rule until a new president, to be chosen in November 29 elections, takes office in January.\n\n\n\nMicheletti announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation Thursday night.\n\n\n\nZelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is \"imminent\" and should occur within days.

An agreement appeared possible Thursday when Shannon announced at a news conference that the U.S. delegation would stay another day.\n\n\n\nA delegation from the Organization of American States had visited Honduras in early October but failed to obtain an agreement. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias had held consultations with both sides but did not get them to agree on a solution.\n\n\n\nThe OAS, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the military-backed coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras.\n\n\n\n\"The dark secret here is that the Honduran economy has been devastated,\" Birns said. \"Huge numbers of Hondurans have crossed over into Mexico and are desperate for jobs.\"\n\n\n\nCrumbling economic conditions left Micheletti little choice, Birns said.\n\n\n\n\"All along Micheletti was holding a diminishing deck,\" he said. \"Not only the poor were being hurt.

So there was a very strong economic motive to reach a solution.\"\n\n\n\nThere also was a strong political motive, Hakim said.\n\n\n\n\"The candidates for president, the people looking forward, wanted to see the elections on November 29 as being legitimate,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBirns agreed that \"the candidates wanted a resolution because of legitimacy.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States and many other nations had said the elections would be considered illegitimate if held under Micheletti's rule.\n\n\n\n\"By far, the most important thing right now is not whether Zelaya will be reinstated, but that the U.S. is going to recognize the elections,\" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm.\n\n\n\n\"The next president will be able to receive diplomatic recognition and much-needed access to international aid and financing, which will be crucial given the weakness of the economy and the fact that the government is running out of money,\" she said.\n\n\n\nZelaya also appeared to have little choice but to accept the pact, even though it does not automatically return to him to power, as he had demanded all along.\n\n\n\n\"He didn't have many options, did he?\" said Casas-Zamora of the Brookings Institution. \"He was never able to mobilize people in the numbers he claimed to have. He didn't have much clout, frankly. Holed up in the Brazilian Embassy he became much more marginalized. That's as good as it gets for him.\"\n\n\n\nThe president's four-year term -- whether it's Zelaya or Micheletti -- ends January 27, when the new head of state will take over.\n\n\n\nBerkman believes Zelaya heard the clock ticking.\n\n\n\n\"Zelaya probably accepted this agreement because he was running out of time and leverage, and he may have thought that going through congress was his best bet at getting an agreement in his favor,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBirns sees it as a face-saving move.\n\n\n\n\"The only thing Zelaya gets out of this is the dignity of serving out his complete term,\" Birns said. \"He will be a president without any authority. Basically, he's been rendered into a figurehead president.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the formation of a reconciliation government, the pact also stipulates -- at Zelaya's insistence -- that there will be no amnesty for those involved in his ouster.\n\n\n\nMicheletti said in an interview Friday evening with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that he's certain Zelaya will try to prosecute him. Just a few weeks ago, it was Micheletti who was saying Zelaya would be prosecuted if he left the Brazilian Embassy.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, we are certain that there will be persecution,\" Micheletti said Friday. \"But I am not afraid. What we did was within the constitution.\"\n\n\n\nMicheletti has insisted Zelaya was removed through constitutional means, not a coup.\n\n\n\nSome analysts say legal proceedings might not be the best course.\n\n\n\n\"Any attempt to seek revenge here is going to be costly and inefficient and conflictive,\" said Birns, head of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.\n\n\n\nThe pact also calls for the creation of a \"truth commission\" to investigate the events surrounding Zelaya's ouster; the formation of a \"verification commission\" to ensure that the agreement is adhered to; and a solicitation to the international community to lift economic and diplomatic sanctions.\n\n\n\nThe political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal.\n\n\n\nZelaya has said since his ouster he would not try to revive the issue if returned to power. That's a good thing, Hakim said.\n\n\n\n\"The most important thing,\" he said, \"are the assurances that Zelaya will be limited in his powers.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "cartel.\n", "answer_start": "1002"}], "question": "Who is the  Aztecas street gang affiliated with?", "id": "69", "answers": [{"text": "cartel.\n", "answer_start": "1002"}, {"text": "Juarez drug ", "answer_start": "990"}, {"text": "cartel.\n", "answer_start": "1002"}, {"text": "Juarez drug ", "answer_start": "990"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- The Mexican military has arrested a suspect in the killings this month of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police and federal spokesmen said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrested man is Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Juarez newspaper El Diario, the suspect also was sought in connection with at least one other homicide: the killing of Zapata Reyes, a member of the rival Mexicles gang.\n\n\n\n\n\nValles de la Rosa reportedly has U.S. ties, having been charged with 10 counts related to drug trafficking in the United States, local media said.

Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\nThe dog, Bo, has triggered \"the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s,\" the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club's Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member.\n\n\n\nJane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has \"received about a 10 percent increase in calls\" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls.\n\n\n\n\"Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed,\" Teasley said. \"But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research.\"\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs are \"active athletes,\" far from couch potatoes, she explained.\n\n\n\nIn fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun \u00bb\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said.\n\n\n\nAnd don't think you can close the door and keep them out. \"They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,\" she said.\n\n\n\nTeasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are \"not apartment dogs,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHarding agreed. \"They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,\" she joked, \"we recommend a stuffed dog.\"\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers.\n\n\n\nHarding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because \"they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work.\"\n\n\n\nFor other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, \"Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed.\"\n\n\n\nTeasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the \"Dalmatian syndrome.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the movie \"101 Dalmatians\" came out in 1996, \"thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,\" Teasley said.\n\n\n\nWhat those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said.\n\n\n\nBoth Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,\" Harding said.\n\n\n\nShe has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said \"produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles\" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America.\n\n\n\nSuch organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners.

That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit.\n\n\n\n\"It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),\" Teasley said, \"But I'm not.

Now you can add winner of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" to Joan Rivers' lengthy resume.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump and Joan Rivers attend \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" season finale Sunday in New York.\n\n\n\nAfter weeks of competition, the 75-year-old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants, including Dennis Rodman, Tom Green and Brian McKnight, to take the top spot in this season's edition of the reality show hosted by Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nRivers went up against poker champion Annie Duke in Sunday night's finale in which both women were charged with planning a VIP party and silent auction for the last and deciding task.\n\n\n\n\"They're both tough, they're both smart and they both hate each other,\" Trump observed at the beginning of the show.\n\n\n\nThe apparent tension between Rivers and Duke continued in the final boardroom, part of which played out in front of a live audience, with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as Trump looked on.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Duke raised far more money at her event, but Rivers was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party, and Trump declared her the winner of the competition.\n\n\n\n\"Your level of energy has been amazing,\" he told Rivers.\n\n\n\nThe victory means $250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver.\n\n\n\nIf the series thrives on conflict, it got plenty of mileage out of Rivers. She blew up at country singer Clint Black, referred to another contestant as a \"stupid blonde\" and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point.\n\n\n\nBut Rivers seemed to be especially infuriated by Duke, calling her a \"despicable human being\" -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in Duke's direction over the course of the series.\n\n\n\nRivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter, and fellow contestant, Melissa was fired from the show. The exit, complete with bleeped obscenities, was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like Rivers might not come back, but she returned to the show for the next task.\n\n\n\nYou might think a show that's best known for the phrase \"You're fired\" might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces, but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week, according to Entertainment Weekly. EW: Did the right one win?\n\n\n\nRevived formula\n\n\n\n\"The Apprentice\" made a splash when it debuted in 2004, making a reality television star out of Trump and contestants such as Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations.\n\n\n\nThe contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n\n\nThe tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity.\n\n\n\nThe first \"Celebrity Apprentice\" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on \"Britain's Got Talent\" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show.\n\n\n\nMorgan also made several appearances on this season's \"Apprentice,\" sitting in as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another.\n\n\n\nMorgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing on the show herself.\n\n\n\nNBC announced last month it is bringing back \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" for another installment in the spring of 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Knox's parents ", "answer_start": "1188"}], "question": "Who are not doing great?", "id": "2107", "answers": [{"text": "Knox's parents ", "answer_start": "1188"}, {"text": "Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, ", "answer_start": "1033"}, {"text": "Knox's parents ", "answer_start": "1188"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Esse do aliquam incidunt sed enim deserunt ratione qui", "id": "132265e0aa9fa4a4a2297fbc08d88236bdaNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Amanda Knox is a murderer", "id": "286ea5545647e3d4e24aac6ddd6af7b8e96NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Aliquip incididunt officia et vel est culpa modi quasi inventore in exercitationem", "id": "682b95af7098fbc4508b737baacd631b05dNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Et maxime laborum aliquip ducimus dolores perferendis illum magni accusantium ipsa labore quasi dolor ut sunt in", "id": "7016738a4c83fbd417eabc30783654be9c3NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Sitting at her home in West Seattle, Washington, Amanda Knox's aunt Janet Huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it,\" Huff said of the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word.

In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, \"You don't do these things twice.\"\n\n\n\n2. \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt\n\n\n\nEx-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach.\n\n\n\n3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt\n\n\n\nCanutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured.\n\n\n\n4. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard\n\n\n\nThis intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament.\n\n\n\n5. \"GoldenEye\" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels\n\n\n\nThis breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs. This, combined with his high falling velocity, could have proved fatal.\n\n\n\n6. \"Who am I?\" (Wo shi shei) (Jackie Chan, 1998) Stunt: 21-storey slide  Stuntman: Jackie Chan\n\n\n\nIt's almost impossible to choose just one of Chan's stunts, but his faintly slapstick 21-storey slide down the side of a skyscraper is pretty impressive -- even more so when you find out he did it without a harness. He never uses stunt doubles or special effects and as a result has broken just about every bone in his body over the years. Now that's commitment.\n\n\n\n7. \"Sharky's Machine\" (Burt Reynolds, 1981)   Stunt: Free-fall jump  Stuntman: Dar Robinson\n\n\n\nAt 220 feet, legendary stuntman Dar Robinson's jump from Atlanta's Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel remains the highest free-fall stunt ever performed from a building for a commercially-released film. Ironically, despite it being a record-breaking fall, moviegoers only see the briefest moment of the actual stunt in the film. The rest of the fall from the skyscraper is disappointingly a dummy.\n\n\n\n8. \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (George Roy Hill, 1969) Stunt: Cliff Leap  Stuntmen: Mickey Gilbert/Howard Curtis\n\n\n\nTrapped by the Superposse, Butch and Sundance leap from the top of a cliff into the boiling waters of a river below. It's set up nicely with some humorous dialogue: \"I can't swim.\" \"Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you!\" Robert Redford and Paul Newman did jump off the cliff, but landed on a ledge with a mattress about six feet below.

As Schwarzenegger's stunt double he performed the T-101's famous motorbike jump into a massive storm drain. To get the effect, his motorbike was rigged up to a web of one-inch cables, to cut the impact when the bike and rider hit the ground. The cables were later digitally erased.\n\n\n\n10. \"Deathproof\" (Quentin Tarantino, 2007) Stunt: Car chase on bonnet  Stuntwoman: Zo\u00eb Bell\n\n\n\nBell won an award at the Oscars of the stunt world, the Taurus stunt awards, for this daredevil action piece. She clings precariously to the bonnet of a car going at 85 miles per hour while receiving hits from a second car in a long, climactic chase scene. Bell is a stuntwoman by trade but it's easy to see why Tarantino flouted the unspoken Hollywood convention that stuntmen stay out of the limelight and cast her as the film's lead.\n\n\n\nAnd five tragic stunts that didn't come off ...\n\n\n\nStunts are a dangerous business, and it doesn't always work out. We pay tribute to five brave stunt men and women who fell in the line of duty.\n\n\n\n1. \"Top Gun\" (Tony Scott,1986)\n\n\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl died during the making of \"Top Gun\" in 1985 after his plane never recovered from a flat spin and plunged into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n2. \"The Crow\" (Alex Proyas,1994)\n\n\n\nMartial arts legend Bruce Lee's son Brandon was shot and killed during a stunt shooting sequence, when the cap of a blank accidentally penetrated his abdomen and lodged in his spine.\n\n\n\n3. \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\" (Joe Dante/John Landis, 1983)\n\n\n\nActor Vic Morrow and child actors Renee Chen and My-ca Dinh Le were instantly killed when a special-effects explosion caused a helicopter to spin out of control and crash down on top of them.\n\n\n\n4. \"Cannonball Run\" (Hal Needham, 1981)\n\n\n\nStuntwoman Heidi Von Beltz was paralysed from the neck down when her sports car crashed head on into a van during a stunt on the set of the film.\n\n\n\n5. \"Armour of God\" (Jackie Chan, 1987)\n\n\n\nChan fell 15 feet while jumping from a wall to a tree branch. He landed hard on his head, causing part of his skull to crack and lodge in his brain. He required major surgery and now has a permanent hole in his head which is filled by a plastic plug."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "is making old, new again in Japan.\n", "answer_start": "14"}], "question": "What did Jero do to the Japanese songs?", "id": "614", "answers": [{"text": "is making old, new again in Japan.\n", "answer_start": "14"}, {"text": "enka.\n", "answer_start": "105"}, {"text": "singing ", "answer_start": "88"}, {"text": "propelled enka into the 21st century ", "answer_start": "565"}], "validated_answers": "{\"14:49\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what was name of first single?", "id": "425d88825637fc24cf1bb9d1788c92af898NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who made the Japanese enka song?", "id": "621c73e8ab64fab40e19bb5c631108acf4eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Jero is making old, new again in Japan.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American Jero is famous for singing Japanese enka.\n\n\n\nThe 27-year-old American has made a name for himself singing enka, a traditional form of lounge music that flourished in 1940's Japan.\n\n\n\nIt seems an unlikely musical style for the Pittsburgh native to pursue.

But I do think that Pakistan has a responsibility to act, and it doesn't matter that they're non-state actors.\"\n\nLast week, Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States. While in New Delhi, India, she called on Pakistan to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders.\n\nPakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said \"stateless actors\" carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis, specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan.\n\nU.S. counterterrorism officials say signs point to LeT, and they haven't seen anything to rule it out. However, they have not definitively said the group is responsible. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said during an appearance Tuesday at Harvard University that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in Mumbai in 2006 -- though he didn't specifically name LeT.\n\nLeT has denied any responsibility for the attacks, but a suspect in custody -- whom India has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by LeT, Indian authorities said. India said its forces killed nine gunmen.\n\nOn Sunday, Rice said LeT and al Qaeda \"tend to travel in the same circles,\" though she declined to directly link either group to the Mumbai attack. But she stressed that Pakistan is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders.\n\n\"Well, I don't want to go into too much detail here because, obviously, in counterterrorism no one wants to tip the hand of what has happened here and what may happen in the future,\" Rice said. \"The important thing now is to get these perpetrators and to prevent follow-on attacks. And Pakistan's cooperation, Pakistan's action, is absolutely essential to doing that.\"\n\nAsked about possible ties between Pakistan's government and LeT, Rice acknowledged \"there have been historic ties -- there's no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"But Pakistan is a different place now with a civilian government and an army leadership that is working in concert to try to bring an end to extremism within Pakistan,\" she said.\n\n\"We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism. So whatever the history here, and there is a history, the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "106-day, 27,900-mile (45,000-kilometer) ", "answer_start": "1840"}], "question": "How many days is the relay through Canada?", "id": "231", "answers": [{"text": "106-day, 27,900-mile (45,000-kilometer) ", "answer_start": "1840"}, {"text": "106-day, ", "answer_start": "1840"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "so good has dame le", "id": "35c790fe144fdd4242a9a20428b97de633NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Will it be coming by runner", "id": "463d91dc8112f5942dea9272771cbf51397NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "qlq mano dame una", "id": "775fc90abcc386a409f84022674c64f5bfbNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "dame 2 mano eres tu", "id": "798f986e141b4b94fa08d2eda5a1d8be5dbNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN)  -- The torch for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was lit in a ceremony at the ancient Greek site of Olympia on Thursday, less than four months ahead of the games' opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\nActress Maria Nafpliotou, as a high priestess, lights the flame for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe torch will be carried on an eight-day trip through Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, before being transported to Canada for what will be the longest domestic torch relay in the games' history, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen dressed in white togas performed a ceremony on the green hillside at Olympia, the home of the Olympic flame and the place where the ancient Olympics took place.

Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards.

I was in Moscow at the  time and it just struck me so much.\n\n\n\nI went back to New York, where I was living at the time, organized a fundraising event and raised $350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area. I believe that play is very therapeutic. It's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children, even if it's only for five minutes.\n\n\n\nBut then I realized that it would be good for all the other children in Russia and I just started raising money and building playgrounds. Now we have 23 places all over Russia and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more.\n\n\n\nI want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in Russia. Each one will cost about $300,000 so it's a big dream -- an expensive one!\n\n\n\nCNN: Let's talk about vodka...\n\n\n\nNV: Our vodka is definitely the best.

After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention at the border while turning a blind eye to employers in the interior. That's like trying to fill a bucket with teaspoons of water without first plugging the hole at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Obama has fallen into that same trap. He is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence. That's a far cry from the 6,000 troops that Arizona Sen. John McCain had requested, and congressional Republicans seem miffed that Obama stole their thunder.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, as long as the troops follow the protocol laid out in 2006 when George W. Bush launched Operation Jumpstart -- that they're unarmed and act only in a support capacity to the Border Patrol by fixing vehicles, monitoring surveillance equipment, repairing fences -- I think sending the National Guard is a fine idea. It's just not the magic bullet that the most enthusiastic proponents of the idea would have us believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's only one of those. It involves fining, arresting and prosecuting the employers of illegal immigrants, including people who are, this election year, streaming into fundraisers for McCain, Brewer and other tough-talking Republicans vowing to solve a problem that many of their backers helped create.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Kessler ", "answer_start": "16"}], "question": "Who defeated Froch?", "id": "320", "answers": [{"text": "Kessler ", "answer_start": "16"}, {"text": "Mikkel ", "answer_start": "9"}, {"text": "Kessler ", "answer_start": "16"}, {"text": "Mikkel ", "answer_start": "9"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What number fight did Briton Froch lose his unbeaten record?", "id": "11211cd0b177324d57a0696475adf7d07eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who secures unanimos point?", "id": "116a975c68ca0844303a984d952f3e4be4bNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Mikkel Kessler is the new World Boxing Council (WBC) super-middleweight champion after out-pointing Briton Carl Froch in a bruising encounter in his native Denmark on Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being previously unbeaten after 26 fights, the 32-year-old Froch never looked comfortable against his durable opponent, who was given the decision on all three of the judges scorecards after 12 brutal rounds in front of a partisan and passionate crowd at the MCH Messecenter in Herning.\n\n\n\n\n\nFroch had Kessler on the canvas in the fifth round, but the referee ruled that the Dane had slipped, and the challenger eventually wore the champion down with a combination of hooks and jabs to take the belt by a margin of 117-111, 115-113 and 116-112.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result means 31-year-old Kessler, who has lost just twice in 45 fights, is a world champion again just five months after losing his World Boxing Association (WBA) title to Andre Ward.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough gracious in defeat, Froch questioned if the decision would have gone Kessler's way if the fight had taken place in his hometown of Nottingham, England.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel terrible that I lost my title, absolutely gutted,\" Froch told ringside reporters after the fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to make a mockery of anything but I feel if it was at home in my town, the decision would have gone the other way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: \"I took some big punches off a big puncher and I've got to give Kessler the credit he deserves.

But when an agent misspells his wife's name, he must embark on an odyssey to ensure she'll be allowed to use her tickets. Will he be successful?\n\n\n\nQ: I recently bought tickets to Italy by calling Expedia. I spelled my wife's first name to the agent. That afternoon we left town for a trip. When we returned the tickets were at the front door and a confirmation e-mail was waiting. My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa.\n\n\n\nI immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on \"hold\" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket.\n\n\n\nI contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do?\n\n\n\n-- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas\n\n\n\nA: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.\n\n\n\nThen again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.\n\n\n\nSecond, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)\n\n\n\nI've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them.\n\n\n\nNext time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for \"security reasons\" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they would lose lots of money if passengers could give their tickets to friends and family. Or resell them.\n\n\n\nI contacted Expedia on your behalf, and it issued a new ticket with your wife's name spelled correctly.\n\n\n\nChristopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine.

As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.\n\n\n\nBassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally trap the insect.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Use caution when eating outdoors, especially when sodas or other sweetened drinks are available.\n\n\n\nFor more tips on managing insect allergies, visit the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Web site.

Katie was working part-time in a candle shop, and between them they pulled in a little more than $2,500 a month.\n\n\n\nBut Katie, 21, quit to have the baby, and they moved into a bigger, more expensive house to accommodate their larger family.\n\n\n\nAs June approached, Spieker, 36, was told his hours and commission were being cut as Florida's economy sank.\n\n\n\n\"It got to the point where $6.50 an hour with a house just ain't gonna happen. I was trying to do good for my family, but what can I do?\" he asked. His last day of work in Florida was June 30.\n\n\n\nWith Florida's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he investigated where prospects might be better, settling on Colorado (7.6 unemployment), and if things didn't work out there, North Dakota (the nation's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent).\n\n\n\nThe Spieker family prepared for the trip by holding a yard sale a few days before they were set to leave Trenton, a town of 1,800 near Gainesville. They dutifully cleaned up the home they rented but could no longer afford.\n\n\n\n\"You're not going to pay the rent, you get out of the house, you know?\" Spieker said.\n\n\n\nThey hit the road with $1,000 in cash, a cell phone, some food and what clothing they could fit.\n\n\n\nThe rickety old camper required some minor repairs along the way: a new battery strap after being bounced around on a rough Alabama highway, some brake work after one stuck near St. Charles, Missouri.\n\n\n\nSpieker said he sold wire art in taverns during the journey to earn extra money.\n\n\n\nHe was teased by opportunities that didn't pan out.\n\n\n\n\"I never actually saw this before, but some towns are actually putting billboards up that say 'This town has jobs,' \" he said of his travels through the nation's heartland.\n\n\n\n\"I actually went to check it out,\" he said. \"They've got a couple jobs, but nothing really great. They've got some jobs I'm not qualified for, in the medical field,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStill without work after arriving in Colorado, the Spiekers lived \"out in the woods\" for a few weeks. They didn't consider themselves homeless, John Spieker said, \"just camping.\"\n\n\n\nUsing computers at a local office supply store and the library, Spieker and his family have been able to tap private and public assistance to care for themselves.\n\n\n\nA local church has taken care of some day-to-day needs.\n\n\n\n\"I went down and talked to them and said, 'Hey this is what the situation is, if there's any help available.' They said they could probably help us out with food, baby needs,\" Spieker said.\n\n\n\n\"And we're actually going to apply for medical assistance.\"\n\n\n\nAs for food stamps, Spieker said he'd rather the program be used on the infirm than someone like himself who could provide -- no matter how meager the fixings -- for his family.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure there's other people out there that don't have the motivation or the ability [to work] that can use the food stamps,\" he said.\n\n\n\nKatie doesn't fret about the family's circumstances either. She said she leaves \"all the financial details up to John.\"\n\n\n\n\"My main job is to take care of Jacob,\" she said.\n\n\n\nLife got a bit easier on July 20, when Spieker landed work at an auto parts store. A person he connected with through an online forum offered the Bailey house for $350 a month rent, a $400 discount off the normal price. The home's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of Colorado, Spieker said, enabling the deal.\n\n\n\nBut the \"For Sale\" sign out front and real estate agent's lockbox on the front door remind Spieker about how temporary his lodgings may be.\n\n\n\nWhile he's grateful for the auto parts job, nothing is certain there either. A national chain is trying to take over the independent retailer, he said.\n\n\n\n\"It's a struggling company,\" Spieker said. \"At the same time, he's busy enough to where he needs three people behind the counter.\"\n\n\n\nHe's making $10 an hour. But he knows that won't keep his family housed when the cheap rent goes away.\n\n\n\n\"At this point we have a place to stay for two or three months. He said 'maybe three, probably two,' \" Spieker said, recounting his landlord's words. \"I like it here. I just need something better-paying,\" he said. If he didn't find something soon, he said, \"At this point, I'll be right back into the same scenario.\" But for the moment, the Spiekers are enjoying what they have.\n\n\n\n\"The house is great. It's a one-bedroom, it kind of looks like somebody decided to build an A-frame. It has a really, really nice view,\" Katie said.\n\n\n\nDrinking in the surroundings on the back porch, John Spieker agrees.\n\n\n\n\"I have the most awesome view,\" Spieker said, looking at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. \"I can't bring myself to walk off the back porch.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Haeftling, ", "answer_start": "201"}], "question": "What is the name of the shop?", "id": "444", "answers": [{"text": "Haeftling, ", "answer_start": "201"}, {"text": "Haeftling, ", "answer_start": "201"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is on the tag?", "id": "51163c7bec4823243f898b87a1b4c32cc94NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "A new company in Germany is trying to break into the fashion business selling stylish clothes designed and produced by prison inmates.\n\n\n\nInmates design and produce the Haeftling range.\n\n\n\nThe company Haeftling, which in English means inmate, has just opened its first store in Berlin. \"We want to have basic, durable, timeless, beautiful clothes,\" said Stephan Bohle, one of the company founders.\n\n\n\nMany of the clothes, cooking aprons and even stainless steel food trays offered in the Berlin store were either designed or manufactured in jails, but not just German ones.\n\n\n\nOne design shows a female comic figure that was drawn by a man sitting on death row in Texas.\n\n\n\nBohle said part of the proceeds from sales go to organizations that support prisoners' rights and better conditions for inmates, like Amnesty International.\n\n\n\nBut in some cases, money goes directly to the inmates that designed certain pieces. \"In the case of the female cartoon figure, this man was almost granted a stay from execution because of the design he did for us but in the end unfortunately the appeals court ruled against him,\" Bohle said\n\n\n\nThe clothes offered at the Haeftling shop also tell the story of the inmates that designed individual pieces.

Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain.\n\n\n\nScientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger. But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of \"brain hacking\" should be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n\"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,\" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.\n\n\n\n\"But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake.\"\n\n\n\nHackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs?\n\n\n\nAccording to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom.\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,\" Kohno said. \"As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago.\"\n\n\n\nSome might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients.\n\n\n\n\"It happened on two separate occasions,\" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. \"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread.\"\n\n\n\nIn some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to \"self-prescribe\" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers.\n\n\n\nDespite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of \"neurosecurity,\" a term the group coined to describe their field.\n\n\n\n\"The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,\" Kohno said. \"I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security.\"\n\n\n\nKevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. \"When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers.\"\n\n\n\nIt's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. \"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\nHistory provides plenty of examples of why it's important to think about security before it becomes a problem, Kohno said. Perhaps the best example is the Internet, which was originally conceived as a research project and didn't take security into account.\n\n\n\n\"Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind,\" the researchers wrote, \"it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today's security goals.\" Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world, by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality.\n\n\n\n\"The first thing is to ask ourselves is, 'Could there be a security and privacy problem?'\" Kohno said. \"Asking 'Is there a problem?' gets you 90 percent there, and that's the most important thing.\"\n\n\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

If I lived in \"Mad Men\" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper of \"Mad Men\" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"Mad Men\" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being \"on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to \"turn it off\" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special. The Frisky: 10 things women don't understand about men\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are reasons why Draper's wall is so high and impenetrable. Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing \"I don't love you anymore?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat. I saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful, and I wanted more of it. It was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for, like his support of Peggy Olson, his disinterest in Pete Campbell's brown-nosing, his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season, and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett's jaw.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Tony Soprano before him, the behavior that would be massively unacceptable in real life is sometimes dwarfed by his acts of kindness, loyalty, and strength. The Frisky: When did you know it was over?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I (and I think lots of other women) mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- Don Draper. This season -- which started August 16 -- I'm sure we'll see more cracks in Don Draper's facade, and it should be compelling and exciting to watch. But in real life, with a real Don Draper, I could only do so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nI made as many cracks as I could, but they repaired themselves and I wasn't able to get close enough to try again. In retrospect, thank God. That's why I'll give my attention to Don Draper once a week, from the comfort of my couch, but never again in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nTM & \u00a9 2009 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "100,000 ", "answer_start": "2471"}], "question": "How many in numbers are there", "id": "1279", "answers": [{"text": "100,000 ", "answer_start": "2471"}, {"text": "100,000 snakes ", "answer_start": "2471"}, {"text": "83 eggs.\n", "answer_start": "697"}, {"text": "100,000 ", "answer_start": "2471"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "When will they be gone", "id": "2987fa44419e2174a8190160e7dcfc21c57NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Do huge snakes breed quickly?", "id": "3037f689d0abad34a9a8f01d280f22640a9NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular.\n\n\n\nReptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades.\n\n\n\n\"The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed.\n\n\n\nAnd breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs.\n\n\n\nThey are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading.\n\n\n\n\"It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,\" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python.\n\n\n\nVolunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons.\n\n\n\nA \"Python Patrol\" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find.\n\n\n\n\"The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,\" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.\n\n\n\n\"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.\n\n\n\nThe state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.\n\n\n\nOn one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him.\n\n\n\nFinally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. \"Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,\" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck.\n\n\n\nHe got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm.\n\n\n\n\"This isn't a big one,\" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: \"At least 12 [feet.]\"\n\n\n\nWasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them.\n\n\n\nHe says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something.\n\n\n\n\"One down, 100,000 to go,\" he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Defense of Marriage ", "answer_start": "627"}], "question": "The criticism over what act caused the move?", "id": "212", "answers": [{"text": "Defense of Marriage ", "answer_start": "627"}, {"text": "Defense ", "answer_start": "627"}, {"text": "Marriage ", "answer_start": "638"}], "validated_answers": "{\"627:647\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "trash what does the coverage include?", "id": "4607eb71bc958cb4bc09a014d3737571138NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees Wednesday, calling it \"a historic step\" but promising more action to come.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office.\n\n\n\n\"We've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally, to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions. Obama said he still wants to repeal the act.\n\n\n\n\"I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with state's rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe memorandum he signed Wednesday means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House.\n\n\n\nBut it does not grant full health-care coverage, which would require an act of Congress, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nAs details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday, the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic.\n\n\n\n\"I have to say, as a federal employee, I'm really disappointed,\" Lisa Polyak, 48, of Baltimore, Maryland, said of Obama's expected memorandum.\n\n\n\nPolyak, who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades, is with the Army Medical Department. She was among the two dozen authors of the Dallas Principles, a set of eight statements that seek to guide the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community toward \"full civil equality,\" according to the document's preamble.  Watch CNN's Paul Steinhauser discuss Obama's intent on benefits to same-sex partners \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"The benefits that the president might be announcing are already available,\" said Polyak, who has a partner and two children. \"This isn't new. This isn't different.\"\n\n\n\nShe said federal employees are able to take sick leave for \"anyone that was the close approximation of family\" and said the long-term-care option has been available for people under the same category. Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles.\n\n\n\nAsked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are \"subject to the whim of a supervisor.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional. He is making it mandatory. And he's making it clear that this is now the policy of the federal government.\"\n\n\n\nPolyak disagreed, saying, \"The idea that this was a fly-by-night [is] ... not true. I used it routinely.\"\n\n\n\nShe added, \"It was guidance that everyone took advantage of and continues to take advantage at this moment.\"\n\n\n\nGay and lesbian advocates have also faulted the Obama administration for not moving to repeal the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that bars officials from asking about a service member's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it, and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same-sax orientation is discovered.\n\n\n\n\"There's so little we can say until we know what it is,\" said Carisa Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a legal advocacy group that is challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nSection 3 prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same-sex married couples.\n\n\n\n\"Laws have to change ... and in particular, the Defense of Marriage Act needs to change, so whatever the few benefits that the president as an employer can grant, there won't be a lot of them,\" Cunningham said.\n\n\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996.\n\n\n\nObama rankled gay advocates in January when he selected mega-church pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration. Warren, in an interview with Beliefnet, likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest. He also supported California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state.\n\n\n\nDuring the Warren controversy, Obama -- who frequently spoke out in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same-sex marriage -- declared himself \"a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "managing ", "answer_start": "1920"}], "question": "What was his reported biggest obstacle?", "id": "2124", "answers": [{"text": "managing ", "answer_start": "1920"}, {"text": "time.

He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, \"How do you feel about your weight?\" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Middle East, ", "answer_start": "2272"}], "question": "Where did the iReporter grow up?", "id": "193", "answers": [{"text": "Middle East, ", "answer_start": "2272"}, {"text": "Middle East, ", "answer_start": "2272"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- From street corners, buses and subways to phone calls, e-mails, text messages, online posts and tweets, people around the world commented, pondered, and paid tribute to pop legend Michael Jackson, who died Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nPedestrians in Sydney, Australia, watch a TV screen announcing Michael Jackson's death on Friday.\n\n\n\nAround midnight at London's Leicester Square, as news of Jackson's death spread, Luis Carlos Ameida and his friends were surrounding a car listening to the star's music.\n\n\n\nAmeida said he'd gotten tickets to see Jackson at his \"This Is It\" concerts beginning on July 13 in London.\n\n\n\n\"From a young age, you know, I used to have the video game,\" said Ameida. \"I used to have the white suit, and I'd wear it on my birthday.

of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community.\n\n\n\nBani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, called Iran's assertion \"utterly baseless.\"\n\n\n\n\"The allegations are not new, and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue,\" Dugal said on Wednesday, quoted in a news release issued by the Baha'i movement.\n\n\n\n\"The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha'i community, and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan.\"\n\n\n\nIranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said the people were detained for \"security issues\" and not their faith, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said.\n\n\n\nElham said on Tuesday that the Baha'is were members of a group working together \"against national interest.\"\n\n\n\n\"The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners, the Zionists in particular,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha'is, the United States, Canada, the European Union and humanitarian groups.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979, when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is say they have been killed, jailed and \"otherwise oppressed\" only because of their religion.\n\n\n\n\"The best proof of this is the fact that, time and again, Baha'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha'i beliefs and convert to Islam, an option few have taken,\" Dugal said.\n\n\n\nDugal said Iran's practice of connecting the group to Zionism, the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state, was a \"distortion\" and an attempt to \"stir animosity\" among the Iranian public.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'i World Center, which the movement refers to as its \"spiritual and administrative heart,\" is in the Acre/Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire's rule of Palestine.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is explain that their founder, Baha'u'llah, \"after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia, was exiled, with members of his family and a small band of his followers, to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868.\"\n\n\n\nDugal said the Iranian actions were the \"most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha'is as agents of foreign powers, whether of Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless.\"\n\n\n\nDugal said the government's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be \"no prophet following Mohammed\" and that the faith \"poses a theological challenge to this belief.\"\n\n\n\nThey say Baha'u'llah is regarded by Baha'is as \"the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed.\"\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is-- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members across the globe, and about 300,000 in Iran."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Phil Spector ", "answer_start":

was hopelessly deadlocked.\n\n\n\nPhil Spector did not testify at his five-month murder trial. The jury said it was split 10-2.\n\n\n\nThe jury deliberated for 12 days, taking six ballots, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.\n\n\n\nJurors told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler they were split 10-2, without indicating which way they were leaning. They added there was nothing Fidler could do to help them arrive at a unanimous verdict.\n\n\n\nFidler discharged the nine men and three women, thanking them for their service.  Watch what the jurors have to say \u00bb\n\n\n\nSpector went on trial in April, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of B-movie queen Lana Clarkson after a night out in the clubs of Hollywood.\n\n\n\nThe judge told attorneys to return to his Los Angeles, California, courtroom on October 3 to discuss the next legal move.\n\n\n\nSpector, 67, did not take the witness stand at the trial.\n\n\n\nDeliberations were arduous, entering the third week on Monday. Last week, jurors received new instructions on the law and were told to start over after the foreman declared the panel was deadlocked 7-5.\n\n\n\nThe jury's inability to reach a verdict capped a five-month trial that played like a Hollywood film noir classic -- with a twist of the bizarre.\n\n\n\nA 6-foot-tall, blue-eyed blonde with a toothpaste commercial smile, Clarkson was known for her roles in \"Barbarian Queen\" and \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" But at 40 the parts were few and far between and she had taken a $9-an-hour job as a VIP hostess at the House of Blues in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nSpector invented the \"wall of sound\" in the 1960s and worked with the Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner and other acts. Normally reclusive, Spector had spent a rare night out on the town, found Clarkson at the House of Blues at closing time and invited her home for a drink in the wee hours of February 3, 2003.\n\n\n\nAfter initially turning him down, she agreed to accompany him, according to testimony.\n\n\n\nHours later, police were summoned to Spector's mansion in Alhambra, a suburb of Los Angeles. The diminutive music producer had wandered into the driveway in the predawn and told his Brazilian-born chauffeur, \"I think I killed somebody,\" according to the driver's testimony.\n\n\n\nClarkson was found inside, slumped in a chair in the foyer. She had been shot in the mouth. A .38-caliber Colt Special revolver lay at her feet. It appeared someone had attempted to clean up the blood with a diaper found in the guest bathroom.\n\n\n\nSpector's attorneys argued that Clarkson  was depressed over a recent breakup, grabbed the gun and  took her own life.\n\n\n\nBut prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace, with five women telling harrowing tales on the witness stand of the music producer threatening them with firearms. Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"\n\n\n\nAt issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did. In photos projected on a large screen, the gruesome crime scene resembled a set decorated for a horror film.\n\n\n\nIn all, 77 witnesses testified and more than 600 pieces of evidence were submitted. The evidence cart wheeled into the jury room was piled high with exhibits.\n\n\n\nThe jury even toured the scene of the alleged crime.\n\n\n\nThe experts' testimony differed widely on what the physical evidence showed.\n\n\n\nProsecutors pointed to the leopard print purse slung over Clarkson's shoulder as evidence she was trying to leave when she was shot.\n\n\n\nThe defense argued that blood-spatter evidence on the white women's jacket Spector wore showed he was standing too far away to place the gun in Clarkson's mouth.\n\n\n\nSpector hired and fired a who's who of legal talent for his defense. High profile defense attorneys who have left the case include Leslie Abramson and Bruce Cutler.\n\n\n\nHe also changed hairstyles several times during the trial, and wore flamboyant clothing, including frock coats and pastel-colored ties and pocket handkerchiefs.

No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, \"likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,\" Jensensius said. \"There have been less severe thunderstorms there.\"\n\n\n\nSummer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks \"Lightning Safety Awareness Week\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe agency's message is \"When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.\" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors.

Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more).

In short, there's nothing to worry about with an airline like American, but I thought it would be a good idea to devote this week's column to the issue since it's at the top of mind for many travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill American go bankrupt? I'm certainly not qualified to answer that question. Only the airline itself knows its plans, but the balance sheet certainly doesn't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, American has been losing money recently while others have profited, but at the end of June, it had more than $5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then. That doesn't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection, which should be a last resort. Even if it does for some strategic reason, flights wouldn't be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt, because airlines around the world shut down every year. It's always good to know what you can do. Here is some advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways pay with a credit card\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you buy a ticket, you might be paying for something (a flight, presumably) that you won't use for another year. That's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money, and that's why you should pay with a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you buy a ticket with a credit card, then you won't be on the hook if your airline goes under. In fact, when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble, credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs. That way, if the airline doesn't perform, the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodically check in on your airline\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds silly when you're talking about an airline like American, because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection. But what if you bought a ticket on Kuwait-based Wataniya Airways? Would you even know that it shut down in March of this year? Probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the U.S., it can't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it's still flying. Most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better, you can set up an alert via Google that will send you a note anytime an airline's name pops up in the news. This is hardly necessary for the better-known airlines around the world, of course, but it's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a backup plan\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another, have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action. Find out what other airlines fly where you need to go, and be ready to try to pounce if something happens. If you're prepared, you'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what's happening. But you'll still have to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't expect help from other airlines\n\n\n\n\n\nThere used to be a rule in the U.S. that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee. That doesn't exist anymore, so don't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under. Elsewhere in the world, there can be varying levels of assistance, but it's best to just assume that you'll get none. At best, you'll be lucky to find an airline that will take you on standby, but that's not necessarily helpful for people with set plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the best advice is to just be alert. If your airline stops flying, act quickly to find the best alternate options, and you'll still get where you need to go. But if you're worried about a big airline failing here in the U.S., I wouldn't get too worked up about it. The chances of that are incredibly slim, even if bankruptcy is involved."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "3,000 ", "answer_start": "667"}], "question": "How many protesters gathered at the Sudanese Embassy?", "id": "985", "answers": [{"text": "3,000 ", "answer_start": "667"}, {"text": "3,000 ", "answer_start": "667"}, {"text": "3,000 ", "answer_start": "667"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What was Saturday?", "id": "89906587fb7ca54165979ee140f77f0c97NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What has the conflict killed?", "id": "41431f542b4fa8e4444a3357dcce214945bNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who is shouting \"Hey Bush, you can't hide!

Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category.\n\nThen there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French .\n\nPaul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual \"boat\" became airborne and flipped.\n\nLarsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots.\n\nEven the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg.\n\nAccording to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost.\n\n\"Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues.\n\nThe development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records.\n\n\"The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,\" the spokesman said.\n\nHe said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work.\n\n\"It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,\" he said.\n\nThe spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts.\n\nThe WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "inaugural events ", "answer_start": "5840"}], "question": "What remains the same?", "id": "189", "answers": [{"text": "inaugural events ", "answer_start": "5840"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "When will the national mall be opened ?", "id": "594a38f77fdd6b0487a9273ce3962ba28ccNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of visitors to the National Mall crowded Metro stations around Washington on Tuesday, slowing movement to a crawl after the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.\n\nA security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama's inauguration.\n\n\"All of our stations are overcrowded,\" said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. \"It's taking hours for people to get back into the stations.\"\n\nPolice were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said.\n\nBut as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience.\n\nAs of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go.\n\n\"Throughout the weekend, we've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds,\" said Metro General Manager John Catoe. \"By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go.\"\n\nMonday's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record.\n\nThe Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone.\n\nCrowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office.\n\nA crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane's, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security.\n\nOfficials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be.

It's unclear what, if any, action might be taken against the mother.\n\nTuesday in Washington, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen were deployed on land, water and in the air in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration was secure.\n\nThe security effort involved Secret Service agents; 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions; 10,000 National Guardsmen; about 1,000 FBI personnel; and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard were ready to respond if there was an emergency, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.\n\nSecurity planners drew up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect.\n\n\"Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,\" he said.

Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. \"In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.\n\n\n\nHe made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor.

Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.\n\n\n\nKapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's \"Pukar.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy \"Badhaai Ho Badhaai,\" and he went on to produce \"Gandhi, My Father,\" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal.\n\n\n\nFor years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies.\n\n\n\nBut like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations.\n\n\n\nSee Anil Kapoor's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" success in photos. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast.

He is a goodwill ambassador for Plan India, an organization that helps street children, and he donated his entire \"Slumdog\" fee to the cause.\n\n\n\nAs he prepares to travel to Britain for the Bafta awards and to Los Angeles for the Oscars, Mr India remains characteristically self-effacing. \"I feel so humble and grateful.

(OK, so not everyone is brilliantly punny.) The following is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is the big message you're hoping to get across with this book?\n\n\n\nKenneth Cole: The message is that these are extraordinary times. They're transformative in so many ways. And America recently expressed the reality that there is an appetite for meaningful, significant, social change like we've never seen before.\n\n\n\nCNN: In the introduction of your book, you talk about how you've met a lot of people who have inspired you. Is there one person who stands out above the rest?\n\n\n\nCole: There are so many people that inspire me, and there are 90 role models in this book, some of whom I've been very close to. I am the closest of all to my wife, who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness -- and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do. So she's inspired me and she's done great stuff. So I think I'll stay with that answer.\n\n\n\nCNN: In Robert Redford's essay on freedom of speech, he encourages the use of humor when speaking out about a cause someone feels passionate about. Has humor helped you?\n\n\n\nCole: I think it does. I agree with Mr. Redford, and he's been a model of mine. ...\n\n\n\nAnd I think we also have these walls around us, and when people disagree, we're inclined not to listen, but to a degree you can break through that wall often with humor. Jon Stewart has shown us how to do that, as have some other people who are in the art of doing it well.\n\n\n\nCNN: What's your biggest hope for President-elect Barack Obama's presidency?\n\n\n\nCole: He has already surpassed my greatest hopes. I think he's created a sense of spirit and energy and opportunity in this country that we've never seen. And I think it has transformed, in a sense, who we are as a nation globally within 24 hours. We saw that happen.\n\n\n\nCNN: How does a successful fashion designer, who also has a big conscience, feel in a weak economy?\n\n\n\nCole: I think it's an extraordinary opportunity. There are only so many things we can do that make us feel better. We pick up the newspapers and we want to cry every day. We turn on the news and we want to jump out the first window, jump in front of the first truck. And there's not a lot you can look forward to right now ... but you can make yourself look better, and if you look better, you'll feel better, and it becomes self-fulfilling. I think fashion can do that to you.\n\n\n\nYou can do it with some older stuff and mix it with newer stuff, or you can just do new cool stuff by a new cool American designer (smiles). And starting from the ankles down, and then up.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you think that fashion gets a hard rap? [Are] people too quick to write it off as frivolous and underestimate its power?\n\n\n\nCole: I've struggled with that over the years. Is fashion relevant? Is it frivolous? Is it trivial? Because I give so much of my essence to it, as do everybody I work with.\n\n\n\nI've come to two conclusions. One is that it's as relevant as anything, because most of the people you encounter in a given day don't get to know anything more about you than how you appear. You're making a very thoughtful statement ... so I think fashion is important.\n\n\n\nAnd then at the end of the day if someone you know is sick or someone you know can't afford the roof over their head or the food on the plate, then it becomes not so important.\n\n\n\nSo I think it's relevant, and for me it's been an extraordinary resource for me to do so much. And I love fashion. I think it makes us feel good. And if you feel good, we do good."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"I haven't seen any violence.

That's how cool he is. His songs have been covered by the likes of Guns N' Roses, REM, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Sex Pistols.\n\n\n\nIggy Pop: The wildest man in rock music.\n\n\n\nHe is the wildest wild man of rock and his four-decade career has been marked by drug addiction, self mutilation and onstage nudity -- and at 61 years old he is showing no signs of growing old gracefully.\n\n\n\nBorn on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, Michigan, James Newell Osterberg grew up in a trailer park.\n\n\n\nWhen he began learning the drums as a teenager his parents gave up their bedroom to house his drum kit. It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges.\n\n\n\nIt was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience.\n\n\n\nThe band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing \"No Fun\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\"  See photos of Iggy in action. \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up \"Fun House,\" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as \"the definitive rock album of America.\" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami\n\n\n\nBy this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's \"Raw Power.\"\n\n\n\nWith \"Raw Power,\" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again.\n\n\n\nBy this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs.\n\n\n\nIt was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life.\" The latter included the songs \"The Passenger\" and \"Lust for Life,\" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions.\n\n\n\nMore commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with \"China Girl\" becoming a hit single for Bowie.\n\n\n\nIggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single \"Real Wild Child\" was a hit in the U.S. and UK. But by the end of the decade, Iggy was beginning to be recognized as \"the Godfather of Punk,\" with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence.\n\n\n\nMembers of Guns N' Roses and the B52s appeared on his 1990 album \"Brick by Brick,\" which sold more than 500,000 copies, and his 2003 album \"Skull Ring\" featured the likes of Green Day, Sum 41 and Peaches. But what really made \"Skull Ring\" special was that it re-united Iggy with Ron and Scott Asheton of The Stooges.\n\n\n\nAfter years on the periphery, Iggy was suddenly fashionable, with the reformed Stooges appearing at festivals all over the world. The band recorded the album \"The Weirdness\" in 2007, but it was their astonishingly powerful live performances that showed why they were still such a big deal 40 years after they started out.\n\n\n\nAny hopes Iggy may have had for a peaceful retirement in Miami have been dashed. At 61 years old he is still performing with the same energy and abandon as when The Stooges first formed, with only marginally less stage diving and nudity. It seems that the world has finally caught up with Iggy Pop, the most exciting, unpredictable and entertaining man in rock."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Thomas ", "answer_start": "1253"}], "question": "who was mentoring", "id": "1008", "answers": [{"text": "Thomas, ", "answer_start": "1156"}, {"text": "The judge ", "answer_start": "1463"}, {"text": "Thomas ", "answer_start": "1253"}, {"text": "Thomas ", "answer_start": "1253"}, {"text": "\"He ", "answer_start": "1537"}], "validated_answers": "{\"1463:1473\": 1, \"1253:1260\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "When did they do this", "id": "44894a4a3bb84a54d1aa418e30f27aeeff7NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who could have done this", "id": "496520dce30e88b49b6bdd546646e2aee79NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Where are the documents", "id": "758f6af4c4868eb40649a801f28927057a2NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "who is ex-alabama", "id": "7859f17e79d4c084385a5595813fb644124NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- A former Alabama judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency.\n\n\n\nFormer Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas denies all the charges, his attorney says.\n\n\n\nFormer Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case, including kidnapping, sexual abuse, extortion and sodomy.

Neilson already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges.\n\n\n\nThomas, 48, has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing. Clark told CNN on Tuesday that Thomas was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them.\n\n\n\n\"The whole thing is, he tried to help people in this community,\" Clark said. \"He helped thousands to grow up and be productive citizens.\"\n\n\n\nThe judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office, Clark said. \"He was mentoring them. He was trying to get them to do right, to be productive citizens.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the alleged victims testified Monday that he doesn't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by Thomas, according to The Mobile Press-Register newspaper. But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions, the newspaper reported, and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room, in the small office and at a Mobile fraternity house.\n\n\n\nAnother man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002, Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury, according to the Press-Register. Thomas convicted him of lesser charges, he testified, and sentenced him to a 90-day boot camp. He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse, the newspaper reported. Neither man was identified.\n\n\n\n\"All of them [the alleged victims] were given preferential treatment at some point,\" Nicki Patterson, chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County, told CNN earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\"And ultimately, when some of them refused to continue participating [in the activities], they were given what I would view as excessive sentences. But certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege, the state would say, it was extremely lenient sentences.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, \"two of the individuals said he [Thomas] did nothing bad to them,\" Clark said Tuesday. \"That he didn't paddle them. That he only helped them. ... I mean, the last guy that testified was a murderer. And he's complaining he got assaulted. 'I got assaulted,' -- yeah, right.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether Thomas admits paddling the men, Clark said, \"I didn't say either way. ... I'm saying there ain't no sexual innuendoes.\"\n\n\n\nNeilson has heard arguments on whether an expert should be allowed to testify about sexual fetishes for the prosecution. Clark said the expert has not interviewed any of the alleged victims and that he fails to see how the testimony fits into the case.\n\n\n\nNeilson was brought in to hear the case after all the Mobile County Circuit judges recused themselves -- standard procedure in a case involving another judge.\n\n\n\nThomas resigned from the bench in October 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary on multiple ethics violations charges. The complaint, dismissed after the resignation, accused him of \"extrajudiciary personal contact\" with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact.\n\n\n\nIn April, Thomas told WKRG the allegations against him are false, but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not guilty, and I look forward to being a part of the community that's supported me and I've supported my entire life,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Alabama State Bar suspended Thomas' law license in January after a grand jury handed up the first of two indictments against him. In April, the bar's disciplinary commission upheld the suspension, WKRG reported, despite the fact that Thomas under oath denied all the allegations in the first indictment.

If they can't stuff it in a suitcase, they don't bring it.\n\n\n\nThe Lost Trailers have also partnered with Keep America Beautiful, a national organization dedicated to litter reduction and recycling.\n\n\n\nOn a recent day off in Los Angeles, singer Ryder Lee, guitarist Stokes Nielson, bassist Manny Medina, keyboardist Andrew Nielson and drummer Jeff Potter met up with a group of young adults from the L.A. Conservation Corps for a little coastal cleanup -- country style.  Watch the band at work on the beach \u00bb\n\n\n\nThree of the band members sported cowboy boots as they sifted through the sand. The kids were from South Central Los Angeles, an inner-city area not generally known for its love of country music.\n\n\n\nAfter the cleanup, we pulled the CNN van up to the beach, popped in The Lost Trailers' CD, and hit \"play\" on their hit single, \"Holler Back.\" As the fiddle and banjo strains of the high-octane hillbilly tune blared through the speakers, there were blank stares all the way around from the students.\n\n\n\nBut after joining in the chorus of \"heys\" and \"hos,\" one young man named Virgil LaFlora started rapping over the verses. It was the most unexpected country/hip-hop mash-up since Tim McGraw and Nelly joined forces for \"Over and Over\" in 2004.\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, the two camps had discovered some common ground, and the song ended in cheers and hugs. One girl asked if she could have the CD.\n\n\n\nCNN talked to the Trailers' members about their activism and their tour. The following is an edited version of the interview.\n\n\n\nCNN: \"Lean, Clean and Local\" isn't just about recycling. You guys are actually going into the community and hiring local people.\n\n\n\nStokes Nielson: We did a show with Tim McGraw in New York at the end of last year. It was a fly date for us, so we hired local, and this guy came up to us and said, \"Thank you so much for hiring local, 'cause I haven't had a check in three weeks.\" And we realized as the recession was heading into place, that one of the things we could do to benefit these communities is hire local, and not just bring in our own crews and just extract money form the locals and then leave, but we could also leave a small stimulus of our own.\n\n\n\nCNN: As rising artists, you work hard to earn the right to have a tour bus. Now you're giving it up.\n\n\n\nStokes Nielson: Since we won't have a crew, we thought, \"OK, we're not going to have the bus anymore, and we're just going to fly to dates,\" and that cut down our diesel consumption.\n\n\n\nAndrew Nielson: We travel really light so that we can roll into town, hire the crew, and also hire local equipment. Potter's a drummer, and everywhere we go, we rent drums.\n\n\n\nJeff Potter: We were trying to figure out a way that was practical to get a drum set on a plane, but it didn't really work out. I like it because I get to show up, and somebody working there locally has already set it up for me, and I get to just sit down and play.\n\n\n\nRyder Lee: We were trying to get Potter some of those electric drum pads (which will fit into a suitcase), but that's just not as cool.\n\n\n\nCNN: Or you could just get a drum machine and eliminate the problem altogether! That would save the most money.\n\n\n\nPotter: I like being in the band.\n\n\n\nManny Medina: I'm afraid they're going to hire local bass players, and I'll be out of a job! (Laugh)\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you save money by hiring local, or does it cost you more this way?\n\n\n\nStokes Nielson: No, it's about even. It's not about the money. Obviously, the government is putting a lot of money into trying to get this thing (the economy) kick-started. As small-business owners, we want to do our part as well. It's also really been great to realize that we actually can do something besides just writin' a song and singin' it.\n\n\n\nLee: We've set up a Web site: LeanCleanAndLocal.com, and that's become kind of a Yellow Pages for the local businesses we've hired. And we have videos on there, and a directory of the folks we've used, so if other acts were to hire this way, they could come in and use these same people.\n\n\n\nCNN: Doesn't that lead to disaster sometimes?\n\n\n\nMedina: So far, it's been great.\n\n\n\nPotter: Either we've been very lucky, or we've really come up against some great people, but when you're a national act, there's a certain level of competence with the people you deal with, and that's great to see.\n\n\n\nCNN: I'm sure there were a lot of organizations you looked at before partnering up with Keep America Beautiful. Why that organization?\n\n\n\nLee: I think as country artists, it's really important to preserve the things that we grew up with. We're naturally outdoors men because of where we grew up, and keeping the rivers and streams clean is part of being country, and we're really proud of that. And Keep America Beautiful and their efforts in recycling and litter cleanup was really fitting for us, so it was a natural place to reach out -- not to mention, at our shows, there tends to be a few bottles and cans that build up. (Laugh)\n\n\n\nStokes Nielson: This tour may not last forever. Maybe just until the recession is over. But definitely, we want to do our part to give back.\n\n\n\nMedina: Plus you really get to know the towns better. You meet the people. You don't just stay on your bus, play a show and leave. You really get to know the towns."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "school in South Africa considers the talk-show host heaven-sent, ", "answer_start": "101"}], "question": "What does one mother say about Oprah?", "id": "1123", "answers": [{"text": "\"Oprah is an angel, ", "answer_start": "326"}, {"text": "school in South Africa considers the talk-show host heaven-sent, ", "answer_start": "101"}, {"text": "\"Oprah is an angel, she is God-sent,\" ", "answer_start": "326"}, {"text": "A ", "answer_start": "36"}, {"text": "whose daughter and granddaughter attend ", "answer_start": "45"}, {"text": "Winfrey's ", "answer_start": "91"}, {"text": "\"Oprah is an angel, she is God-sent,\" ", "answer_start": "326"}, {"text": "heaven-sent, ", "answer_start": "153"}], "validated_answers": "{\"101:166\": 1, \"none\": 1, \"326:364\": 1}"}], "context": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- A mother whose daughter and granddaughter attend Oprah Winfrey's school in South Africa considers the talk-show host heaven-sent, despite allegations of abuse being investigated there.\n\n\n\nOprah Winfrey cuts the ribbon at the opening in January of her Leadership Academy in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\"Oprah is an angel, she is God-sent,\" Masechaba Hine said Wednesday from her small home in gritty Soweto township. \"She came to my rescue when my husband was not working.\"\n\n\n\nHine's daughter Palesa and her granddaughter Alebohang, both 14, were among the 152 students chosen to be the first class to attend the high-tech, high-profile Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls when it opened in January. Her faith remains unshaken by the news that South African police have opened a criminal investigation into allegations that a dorm parent mistreated students at the school.\n\n\n\nHine said her children \"have no problems about the school, they are happy about everything.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse, but the academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement issued earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent.  Watch why school is being investigated \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse.\n\n\n\nWinfrey personally selected the school's students, all of them straight-A students from underprivileged backgrounds. The students get free tuition, free uniforms, free accommodation and free meals at the school in Henley-on-Klip, near Johannesburg.\n\n\n\nIn Hine's case, her children's status as the \"poorest of the poor\" that the school aims to serve was clear-cut: Hine supports the five people who live in her small two-bedroom Soweto home on the $50 a week she makes from a fruit and vegetable stand. Hine also is caring for two other orphans -- a niece and a younger granddaughter -- as well as Palesa and Alebohang, whom Hine took responsibility for when her own mother died of AIDS.\n\n\n\nAlong with the money she scrapes together, the family survives on food baskets they receive once a month from a charity.\n\n\n\nHine attended an emergency meeting with Winfrey when the talk-show host came to the school two weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\"She was emotional, she was crying when she was talking about her daughters. It is not our daughters anymore, it is Oprah's daughters,\" Hine said.\n\n\n\nWinfrey did not give the parents details of the allegations other than to say that the dormitory parent \"didn't treat the girls the way she likes,\" Hine said. She said parents were told at the start of the meeting that Winfrey \"does not want the thing to be in the media. It was a private meeting.\"\n\n\n\nThe controversy that now surrounds the school now offers a sharp contrast to the glitter and air of limitless hope when Winfrey brought a gaggle of Hollywood stars with her to officially open the well-appointed school. The criminal probe was opened after a team of three American experts hired by Winfrey gave police the results of their initial investigation, police said.\n\n\n\n\"We came to the conclusion that there were criminal elements and then we opened the case for investigation,\" said Police Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini.\n\n\n\nDlamini told CNN that the team of U.S. experts hired by Winfrey to conduct the internal investigation included Robert Farley, a retired Cook County, Illinois, detective. He said two American social workers were also on the team.\n\n\n\nPreviously, Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- issued a statement on October 17 saying, \"Nothing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy.\"\n\n\n\nIn the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and the dorm parent was removed from the campus.\n\n\n\n\"We have engaged professional investigators of the highest standing from South Africa and the United States to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into these claims,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe school's head has agreed to take a paid leave of absence pending the results of the investigation, although she is not the subject of the allegation, Samuel said.\n\n\n\nThe national prosecuting authority is deciding whether criminal charges will be filed. In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit.

She didn't elaborate.\n\n\n\nThe safety board has called since 2006 for the transit authority to modernize its fleet of transit cars. The agency has sought more safety features and higher technology, such as data boxes on each car that can provide valuable information in case of a crash, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nCiting the most recent federal data, she said the average age of the cars in the fleet was 19.3 years old.\n\n\n\nThe lead train in the crash contained 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars, which are newer and have better technology than the cars in the rear train, with 1000-Series cars.

The recorders provide data on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train.\n\n\n\n\"We've recommended for years that WMATA either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet. They have not been able to do that. And our recommendation was not addressed, so it has been closed in an unacceptable status,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"If there are changes we can make to those cars, we will do so,\" said John Catoe Jr., general manager of the transit authority.\n\n\n\nFenty said 76 people were injured, and two remained in critical condition Tuesday. The condition of another critical patient was upgraded. Two of the injured were emergency responders, Washington Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said.  Watch injured passengers limp from the scene \u00bb\n\n\n\nAll trains were to operate in manual, instead of automatic, mode Tuesday, Catoe said at the briefing. He called the move \"an extra safety precaution\" until there is more information on the crash.\n\n\n\nThe rear train was operating on \"automatic\" mode, which is routine during rush hour, and preliminary evidence shows that the driver may have employed the brakes, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nHersman addressed reports that the trains may have been two months past due on brake inspections, saying, \"We are very interested in looking at those records, and we're interested in looking at all of the records.\"\n\n\n\nShe said cell phone and texting records would also be reviewed, which is standard.\n\n\n\n\"We've investigated a number of accidents where there were distractions,\" she said, adding that it's unknown whether cell phone use was a factor in this crash.\n\n\n\nNine safety board teams will examine aspects such as train operations and communications, signals, tracks, crash-worthiness of equipment, maintenance and survivability -- ease of fleeing the trains after the crash and other survivability factors, Hersman said.\n\n\n\nThe transit authority gave Red Line riders several options for commuting Tuesday morning and was providing free shuttle buses to drive people around the accident scene.\n\n\n\nThe only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there were customer fatalities was in January 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Metrorail stations.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, two trains collided at the Woodley Park/Zoo-Adams Morgan Metrorail station.

Ketamine has become the drug of choice among young people, as the number of people under 21 taking drugs has surged 57 percent in the last four years in Hong Kong, said Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong.\n\n\n\n\"We started off with a very small number of young people taking drugs. We are now more worried about the trend,\" Wong said. \"We don't want a runaway trend; that's why we are stepping up action.\"\n\n\n\nKetamine, an animal tranquilizer, can put users in a dazed stupor for about two hours, doctors said.

Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here.\n\n\n\nHowever, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. \"Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds. That's what our recent data from last year shows,\" Fok said. \"They want to find some other places to take drugs.\"\n\n\n\nThe problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before: random school drug tests.\n\n\n\nBeginning in September, some two dozen schools will conduct tests, as part of a trial program.

I only had one student who was 15,\" he said. \"But now, I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger. That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger.\"\n\n\n\nThere were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs, such as troubled homes and difficulties at school, he said. \"People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost,\" he added.\n\n\n\nHong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses, according to Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong.\n\n\n\nPolice last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs-- mainly to students. One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\n\n\nBut ketamine abuse is not limited to young people. It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong, Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said.\n\n\n\nMany young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan's drug rehab school for youth, which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong. CNN visited the campus, which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls. The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods.\n\n\n\nChan calls the school \"the last stop before jail\" for drug abusers.\n\n\n\nThat was the case for Tai Ming Hung's son Keith, a former gang member. She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago.\n\n\n\n\"I was in denial. I just didn't believe it was true. When I first heard about it, we all didn't know how to react, because we hadn't heard of those drugs before,\" she said. \"I didn't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world. And I was so afraid that it would kill my son.\"\n\n\n\n18-year-old Keith, who said he began using ketamine at the age of 13 when he joined a gang, has recovered and is now living at Chan's school. \"I have a feeling that he's really growing up, he keeps improving,\" his mother said.\n\n\n\nThe school's curriculum involves regular school subjects and chores. The goal is for each student to finish their court probation and either sit for the university exam or continue on to a vocational school.\n\n\n\nMany of the students have become interested in video editing and photography. There is a video lab on campus and the students showed CNN some video projects they have done. Other students run a pizza parlor and tea shop on a neighboring island. The average stay at the school is three years and students are encouraged to plan for life after rehab.\n\n\n\n\"We have vocational training. We help them get some marketable skills; therefore, they may get a job or continue training afterward,\" Chan said. \"I believe everyone deserves a second chance.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n", "answer_start": "373"}], "question": "What did Reid win in 2004?", "id": "417", "answers": [{"text": "Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n", "answer_start": "373"}, {"text": "Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n", "answer_start": "373"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- Frances Reid, best known for her decades-long portrayal of Alice Horton on the soap opera \"Days of our Lives,\" died Wednesday at the age of 95.\n\n\n\n\n\nReid played the role of the martriarch since the long-running soap series' first episode in 1965, and made her last appearance in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nReid was nominated twice for Daytime Emmys, and in 2004 she was awarded a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nNBC said in a statement to CNN that the network \"is deeply saddened by the passing of Frances Reid.

It was an old bike with a broken belt and I had to fix it. Today, people who don't even know me gave me the greatest gift that a president could have: to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Rio deserves this because Rio is a city that has suffered.\"\n\n\n\nFor Lula da Silva, Friday's announcement in Copenhagen, Denmark, that Rio de Janeiro will host the 31st Olympiad in 2016 signified a major achievement not only for his hemisphere (no city in South America has ever before hosted the games) but for him -- a former autoworker and union organizer who defied dizzying odds to become president.\n\n\n\nLula da Silva was born to a peasant family in one of northeastern Brazil's most impoverished areas and migrated as a young man to a city near S\u00e3o Paulo, where he worked as a metalworker, losing his left pinky finger in the process.\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, he became a union leader, said Luiz Valente, chairman of the department of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nDuring the years of military rule from 1964 until 1985, the government cracked down on unions. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in S\u00e3o Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\n\"He was able to negotiate a favorable contract for his union but, from a political standpoint, he demonstrated that worker strikes were possible again in Brazil,\" Valente said.\n\n\n\nDuring the early 1980s, as the military rulers' grip on control loosened, Lula da Silva helped found the leftist Workers' Party.\n\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, he ran for Congress and won, but he chose not to run for re-election. Instead, he set his sights on the top job, waging a losing presidential campaign in 1989, the country's first presidential election since 1960. Successive tries in 1993 and 1997 were unsuccessful, but in 2001, he won and quickly surprised many observers.\n\n\n\n\"When he began, he was perceived as someone very much on the left,\" said Valente. \"He was perceived as being a socialist. However, he has not governed as a socialist. Instead, his economic policies were a continuation of the previous administration's.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, Brazil's economic policy has been \"pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative,\" said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva.\n\n\n\nBut Lula da Silva has worked to help the country's poor, introducing populist measures intended to lower the incidence of poverty and making other moves, Valente said.\n\n\n\n\"As a union leader during the military dictatorship, he learned how to negotiate with the so-called enemy,\" Valente said. \"So Lula is going to try to reach some kind of consensus, and he did. What he did was not a product of ideology but of a pragmatist attitude of the government of Brazil.\"\n\n\n\nLula da Silva's moderate modus operandi has gained him popularity at home, where he has made no moves toward abolishing the term limits that preclude his running for a third term next year, Valente said.\n\n\n\nThat pragmatism has served him well on the international front, where he is on good terms with the leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as with the United States and the European Union. \"Lula knows how to play the game,\" Valente said.\n\n\n\nLike Brazil's president, Rio did not succeed on its first try, having been rejected in an earlier bid -- which inspired planners to be meticulous, Valente said.\n\n\n\n\"They were very well-prepared,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the city two years ago hosted the Pan-American Games, which officials looked on as a trial run for the Olympics, he said. \"Everything ran without a hitch,\" said Valente. \"It was just a beautiful event.\"\n\n\n\nLula's waterworks were no surprise to his countrymen, the professor said. \"He's a very emotional guy and Brazilians tend to be emotional. They're certainly not ashamed of showing their emotions ... It's not unusual for Brazilian men to cry in situations like that. Brazilians actually like to see men cry. They think it's good to show your emotions.\"  Watch the reaction as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is named host city for the 2016 Olympics \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"He always cries when he talks of his mother, who never saw him become president,\" said Fabiana Frayssinet, CNN's correspondent in Rio de Janeiro. \"He's a man who cries, who gets mad. He's an emotional man who says what he thinks whenever he wants.\"\n\n\n\nEmotions were on display Friday on Copacabana beach in Rio, where thousands of people flocked on the first sunny day after two weeks of rain and atypically cold weather.\n\n\n\n\"It was a mix of the end of a football championship with a ... carnival and all the Brazilian festivals,\" Frayssinet said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"unnamed international terror group\" for the attack, ", "answer_start": "393"}], "question": "what local indian official blames?", "id": "253", "answers": [{"text": "Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack.

Ragavendhra, Jaipur's superintendent of police, told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene, and think they were used to carry the explosives. The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them.\n\n\n\nPolice have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them.\n\n\n\nJaipur, known as the \"pink city\" for its rose-colored forts and palaces, is a popular tourist attraction. The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population.\n\n\n\nThe day-long curfew, authorities said, was meant to prevent \"communal violence.\"\n\n\n\nIt was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation, said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal. Also, tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums, he said.\n\n\n\nHome ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJi) of being behind the attacks, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India. No one has claimed responsibility.\n\n\n\nIn the past, officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"foreign\" Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan.\n\n\n\nKashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the region, which is predominantly Muslim.\n\n\n\nPakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.

The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks, she said.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday evening, eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur's walled city. The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of each other. Police defused a ninth bomb.\n\n\n\nThe Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India's financial capital, Mumbai.\n\n\n\nIn July 2006, more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. In that incident, the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes.\n\n\n\nBoth attacks used RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, and ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent in explosives.\n\n\n\nAnd both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays.\n\n\n\nThe Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey king. Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals.\n\n\n\nIn the Mumbai attack, the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour. And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people.\n\n\n\nIndian officials blamed Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack. Pakistan, which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002, denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nThe Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack: the use of bicycles.\n\n\n\nJust as on Tuesday, assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006.\n\n\n\nAt least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion, which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers. That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks.\n\n\n\nHuJi -- or the Movement of Islamic Holy War -- is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\n\n\nIt is banned in neighboring Bangladesh, where it is accused of carrying out several attacks, including a foiled plot to kill the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000.\n\n\n\nAnd it has been blamed for several attacks inside India, including one at the American Center in Calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002.\n\n\n\nIndia ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common, the U.S. State Department said.\n\n\n\n\"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\" the agency said.\n\n\n\nCNN's Tess Eastment and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "10:30 p.m. October 3, ", "answer_start": "3663"}], "question": "When was she last seen?", "id": "1636", "answers": [{"text": "asleep in her crib, ", "answer_start": "3685"}, {"text": "10:30 p.m. October 3, ", "answer_start": "3663"}], "validated_answers": "{\"3663:3685\": 2}"}], "context": "Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley appeared calm and joyful just hours before her baby daughter was reported missing, according to a supermarket clerk who sold her baby wipes, baby food and boxed wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here,\" said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice, who were joined in their search effort by federal authorities last week, have said they have no suspects or solid leads in Lisa's disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Guerrero described the FBI agents' questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They pretty much asked me if she was depressed, ... how she acted around the baby, if she seemed stressed out,\" Guerrero said. \"I told them she never looked depressed around me.

The program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone, and it will provide an answer or ask follow-up questions in order to perform a given task.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the news conference, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing executive, called Siri \"the coolest feature of the new iPhone 4S,\" and the company is expected to advertise Siri heavily in its sales pitches.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. \"Do I need a raincoat today?\" incites a robo-female voice to reply: \"It sure looks like rain today,\" as Scott Forstall, Apple's mobile software executive, demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk Siri to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time, and Siri may ask you to identify her in the phone's address book. Siri then remembers who she is for future requests, Forstall said. The software integrates with Yelp and WolframAlpha for relevant queries. It can also schedule appointments in the phone's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Google's Android phones, users can dictate messages, too, which are then transcribed by Google's servers. Other cell phones support voice commands, which is handy when operating a phone while driving, but few people take advantage of the option. Even the preceding iPhones had a basic version of this called Voice Control, which can be activated in the same way as Siri, by holding down the phone's home button.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Apple's ambitions for Siri are much greater.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Jobs has said that Siri's focus is on artificial intelligence. \"We like what they do a lot,\" the Apple co-founder and former CEO said at the AllThingsD conference last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nForstall echoed that onstage Tuesday, saying: \"I've been in the AI field a long time, and this still blows me away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project was born at SRI International, a nonprofit research organization. It was a part of an ambitious project called CALO, for Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. The program was funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government division responsible for Global Position System (GPS) and developments that led to the creation of the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork on Siri began in the summer of 2007, and SRI executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008. Apple acquired the company in April 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team was so happy when Apple did the acquisition,\" Norman Winarsky, a Siri co-founder who remained at SRI, said in an interview on Monday. \"They have a vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple removed it from the App Store on Tuesday, which means only iPhone 4S owners will be able to access the service starting next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe version integrated into the 4S is vastly superior to the now-defunct app based on onstage demos. Apple spokespeople did not respond to CNN's requests to try the product at the event on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are going to be very proud,\" he said. \"The world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's specialty is in its ability to interpret so-called natural-language requests. It was originally developed to handle typed queries, Winarsky said. For the voice transcription, Siri uses technology from Nuance Communications, Mike Thompson, an exec for Nuance's mobile division, said in an interview on Tuesday. Apple also licenses Nuance's voice transcription for features on the Mac.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Siri, Nuance was spun out from SRI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're thrilled with today's announcement,\" Thompson said. \"What you're seeing today is the beginning of the next generation [of mobile assistants]. That's really the deep integration and the totality of the experience.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor technologists, like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the ability to speak into a digital companion that can understand and respond is a sci-fi dream realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't like to learn programs' methods of doing everything,\" Wozniak said in a recent interview with CNN. \"I just want to speak it and have it happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nApple is betting that Siri's implementation of that will be a major selling point for the new phone. Despite no apparent technical limitations, the software will only be offered on the iPhone 4S at first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Siri is compelling,\" AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega said in an interview after the announcement.

She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \"Tex\" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night.\n\n\n\nTheir sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972.  Watch Atkins, victims' kin speak \u00bb\n\n\n\nBy her own admission, Atkins, known as Sadie Mae Glutz within the Manson family, held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress 16 times. Tate was eight months pregnant. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \"asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\"\n\n\n\nAfter killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the slayings, Atkins scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage.\n\n\n\nIn an interview scheduled to air Friday on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" Linda Kasabian, a former Manson follower who was the prosecution's star witness against Manson and Atkins, recounted the Tate slayings.  Watch Kasabian recall killings \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I started hearing like horrible screaming and I started running toward the house and Sadie came running out and I just looked at her and I said, 'Sadie, please make it stop,'\" Kasabian said. \"And she said, 'I can't. It's too late.' ... It was unreal. It was so real that it was unreal.\"\n\n\n\nOn whether she asked Atkins and the others why they were killing, Kasabian said, \"It wasn't that kind of a scenario. All that I said was, 'Sadie, make it stop.'\"\n\n\n\nFor her safety, Kasabian asked to wear a disguise during the interview, which was conducted last month.\n\n\n\nAs of earlier this year, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. She has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson.\n\n\n\nBut Tate's sister, Debra Tate, told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not think any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were \"so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back.\"\n\n\n\n\"The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,\" Tate said. \"They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do.\"\n\n\n\nIn a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins wrote that \"this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and, no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community, I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'\"\n\n\n\nAtkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months.

Ferguson is Senior Lecturer in Education and Public Policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School. His most recent book is \"Toward Excellence with Equity: An emerging vision for closing the achievement gap,\" published by Harvard Education Press. He is the creator of the Tripod Project for School Improvement and also the faculty co-chair and director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Ferguson says parents can play a key role in improving their children's education.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Raising the quality of teaching and learning in American schools is a priority. It receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the United States and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, achievement gaps between racial groups in the United States remain large. The social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps. Blacks and Hispanics are doing better than in the past compared to whites, but still not nearly good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking schools better should be only one part of our national strategy. Life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goes beyond public policies. I am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading at home is a place to start. I present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack and Hispanic students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites, watched television more, were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and (perhaps as a consequence) were more prone to become sleepy at school. Also, blacks and Hispanics, including those with college-educated parents, reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books. Family-level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later, in elementary school.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning soon after birth, the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning, through lots of active, encouraging, verbal and nonverbal communication. They engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group. Nonetheless, in a recent study by Harvard's Richard Murnane and co-authors, differences in mother-child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one-third of the black-white gap in math and English skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one-quarter at the end of third grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs children get older, highly responsive parents spend time with children, look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions. They are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded. The same parents can also be demanding, providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jelani Mandara of Northwestern University found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks, Hispanics and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Among early adolescents, differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and Hispanics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and Hispanic community leaders as they respond to the fact that even the children of college-educated parents often achieve at lower-than-expected levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is true that children of every racial group do better, on average, when their parents have more education. For example, black 12th graders whose parents completed college have higher average test scores than black 12th graders whose parents only completed high school.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is also true, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, that test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites with highly educated parents -- parents with 16 or more years of schooling -- are greater than test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites whose parents have less education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are unpleasant facts, but we cannot improve what we fear and refuse to confront. Yes, we should respectfully acknowledge and rectify injustices that have impeded the efforts of many non-white parents and we should also work relentlessly to provide high quality schooling opportunities for children from every background.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut especially in our own homes and communities, there is another responsibility. It is to give parents of every racial and social-class background the examples, encouragement and supports they need to help their children experience the joy of learning and develop ambitious attitudes and habits of mind that will serve them well throughout their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one effort to accept this responsibility, the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University has begun convening the AGI Parent Leadership Network. Beginning in September 2008, researchers and parent leaders from communities in several states have met every four months at Harvard to learn about relevant research, trade ideas, coach one another, and share examples of their own leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentations and discussions have covered topics ranging from home-learning lifestyles to ways of helping schools and holding them accountable. The main purpose is to equip parent leaders with ideas and energy for helping others in home communities to help ALL our children succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Civil Rights Movement, legions of people worked in a multitude of ways for racial justice. That work continues. However, the time has come for a movement focused on realizing our full human potential as learners. We need a movement for excellence with equity -- to prepare all our children for the social, ethical and intellectual challenges of a 21st century world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University, click here\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ronald Ferguson."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we ", "answer_start": "372"}], "question": "What kind of leader does America need?", "id": "59", "answers": [{"text": "who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we ", "answer_start": "372"}, {"text": "understands the world today, ", "answer_start": "376"}, {"text": "\"We ", "answer_start": "351"}, {"text": "a president who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we ", "answer_start": "360"}, {"text": "\"We ", "answer_start": "351"}, {"text": "a president who understands the world today, the future we seek and the change we ", "answer_start": "360"}, {"text": "We ", "answer_start": "448"}, {"text": "Barack Obama as the next president of ", "answer_start": "456"}, {"text": "United States.\"\n", "answer_start": "498"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"372:442\": 1, \"376:405\": 1}"}], "context": "DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Former Virginia Gov.

For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood.\n\n\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public.\n\n\n\nThere is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women.\n\n\n\nHe was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies.\n\n\n\nIt is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies'\n\n\n\nOf course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements.\n\n\n\nThat was something that took courage, according to Mann: \"He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness.\"\n\n\n\nDepp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters.

A lawyer from Chile, he was educated there, in Spain and at Harvard Law School.\n\nJos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.\n\n(CNN) -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week: the conviction of their former president, Alberto Fujimori, for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s.\n\nThe Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses, including the massacre of innocent civilians, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful.\n\nIt is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations. Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law.\n\nFujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.\n\nFor a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses.\n\nHe led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges.\n\nThe landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial.\n\nSince then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice.\n\nIn country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials.\n\nPinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished.\n\nAfter the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.\n\nThe ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur.\n\nThe Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.\n\nA second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori. One can hope the second panel will be as transparent and fair as the first.\n\nEven after this verdict, impunity for past atrocities continues to be a major problem in Peru and throughout the region. It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.\n\nThe verdict will also send a powerful message to current heads of state who may be tempted to use abusive tactics to resolve their political problems. As Fujimori discovered yesterday, crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Caylee Anthony, ", "answer_start": "128"}], "question": "Who's death was declared a homicide?", "id": "2681", "answers": [{"text": "Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, ", "answer_start": "112"}, {"text": "Caylee Anthony, ", "answer_start": "128"}, {"text": "Caylee Anthony, ", "answer_start": "172"}], "validated_answers": "{\"128:144\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who saw a bag and came forward?", "id": "169c52d169e75334ac8938d841d19e99ff8NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What are Casey's patents asking for?", "id": "6710cce0a688ab542a7a32daba04bcbc275NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Remains found last week in a wooded area have been identified as belonging to missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, authorities said Friday.\n\n\n\nCaylee Anthony, 2, had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention.\n\n\n\nThe cause of the child's death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means, said Jan Garavaglia, medical examiner for Orange County, Florida.

Maguire often imagines evil, and how those without self-control respond to it.\n\n\n\nMaguire's \"Wicked\" series puts a spin on the classic \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" tale, bringing in corruption, political prisoners and war. His first book, \"Wicked,\" has sold more than 2.5 million copies, and the musical based on the book reportedly has been seen by more than 3.75 million people in New York alone. National tours have been huge successes.\n\n\n\nMaguire's newest book in the series, \"A Lion Among Men,\" tells the story of the Cowardly Lion -- the motherless cub defended by Elphaba in \"Wicked.\"  Watch Maguire roar about \"Lion\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nCNN talked to Maguire about the book's main character, his life before \"Wicked\" and why he has never written realistic adult fiction. The following is an edited version of that interview:\n\n\n\nCNN: To someone who's never read your books before, how would you describe your style?\n\n\n\nGregory Maguire: I would describe [my books] as being, not quite allegories, but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in, and disguised by, the guise of children's stories.\n\n\n\nIn other words, I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy ... and it's going to be fun. And indeed I hope it is fun. But once I get people involved in the plot, I hope to also communicate some of the questions I have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nCNN: Talk to me about Brrr. What's his personality like? What is he going through?\n\n\n\nMaguire: Well, Brrr is the name that I've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called \"A Lion Among Men.\" And I gave him that name for two reasons: One, because it does sound like a shiver, and he is always slightly spooked by the world; and the second reason, because the two letters in it B-r-r-r are both letters from the name of Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion so famously in the 1939 MGM film.\n\n\n\nHis character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the MGM logo ... the ideal lion, and the kind of sad, sacked, out of work, vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when Dorothy actually runs into the lion on the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n\n\nIn other words, there's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we're the most down in the dumps. There's a huge space in between there. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character.\n\n\n\nCNN: Everyone knows of your success with \"Wicked\" -- it's huge. But what was your life like before you wrote that book?\n\n\n\nMaguire: I had written children's books for 14 years before I published \"Wicked.\" And none of them were poorly reviewed, and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed.\n\n\n\nI was the traditional artist in the garret, expecting to live that way or maybe to give up writing soon because I would eventually have to get a job that was going to pay me some kind of retirement package. Silly thought, that, these days.\n\n\n\nCNN: You often take the point of view of the \"wicked\" or \"evil\" characters in your books. How do you get inside their heads?\n\n\n\nMaguire: Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions. But I do seem to have an unconscionable, easy time of thinking about how people might do wrong, of what they might feel like and how they might behave if they had less self-control than I do.\n\n\n\nAnd then also, how they would have to deal with the weight of being called evil. If everyone was always calling you a bad name, how much of that would you internalize? How much of that would you say, all right, go ahead, I'll be everything that you call me because I have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother. By whose standards should I live?\n\n\n\nIn a way, all three of my adult books come down to that question -- by whose standards should I live? Can I find my own standards? Can I recognize them? Can I value them if I can name them? And are they good enough, are they strong enough, standards by which to live?\n\n\n\nCNN: You talked about writing children's books. How is writing for children different than writing for adults?\n\n\n\nMaguire: Well, for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults. So you have to start out active, you have to start out strong and you cannot be, for a moment, self-indulgent.\n\n\n\nEverything has to be a sound bite or something that the children can visualize as if they're running a little Super 8 projector in their mind. Now I date myself with ancient technology, but you know what I mean ... write the scene that you want Steven Spielberg to film, which means every sentence has to give us something to see. Make it intensely visual and this is, I think, the main rule for writing for children.\n\n\n\nBut in no way do I make it less thoughtful. I just actually have to work harder. Writing for children is like the difference between writing a sonnet and writing a gossip column. I mean you have a lot more restrictions so you have to work a lot harder.\n\n\n\nI'm not saying that a gossip column can't be intensely rewarding, but I dare say it's easier to write.\n\n\n\nCNN: Have you ever considered writing anything that's not magical, or more real life?\n\n\n\nMaguire: I have, but I never seem to get very far. In a way, and I don't mean to talk myself down, but sometimes I look at the mysteries of other people and I think, \"How do I know if they think anything like I think?\"\n\n\n\nI can only guess who you might be. You might see the world in a whole different range of colors than I do. You might be super sensitive to nuances of body language or music or ... I just don't know.\n\n\n\nSo I always feel when I try to write realistic fiction for adults, that maybe I don't have enough life experience, even though I'm 54. I'm not sure I trust it.\n\n\n\nBut when I write something that has a magic base to it, I put in everything I do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior, but nobody can call me out and say, \"You don't even know who human beings are\" because I've couched it.\n\n\n\nI suppose it's a kind of safety net for myself, or a security blanket. If I'm writing magic, nobody can say I got it wrong because we all know magic doesn't exist."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "club managers, ", "answer_start": "1294"}], "question": "What were the men?", "id": "2156", "answers": [{"text": "club managers, ", "answer_start": "1294"}, {"text": "club managers, ", "answer_start": "1294"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What was suspect charged with?", "id": "3426d772d20f380452393a68084a29771ecNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What channel does Real Housewives air on?", "id": "3767d598f37177e4e3d8084553e61a6c0eaNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the reality show \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" was mourning the death Saturday of her fianc\u00e9, who died after a fistfight the night before.\n\n\n\nKandi Burruss, at right with co-star NeNe Leakes, appeared at the BET Awards in June.\n\n\n\nThe fianc\u00e9, 34-year-old Ashley \"A.J.\" Jewell, also appeared on the show.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Burruss said the actress was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\n\n\n\"She has no statement to make at this time and asks for privacy,\" Tresa Sanders said.

His nonprofit, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, has provided food, housing, counseling, employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute. To be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was, you know, strange,\" recalled Foster, 54. \"But then to be showcased internationally was tremendous. And it's still reaping benefits today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those benefits is Foster's recent opening of the First Stop Resource Center and Housing Program in Palm Beach, Florida. The center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original Stand Down House. They also bring Foster's long-held dream to fruition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twenty years ago, the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family,\" he said. \"We did come up with Stand Down House 10 years ago, but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans. This year, we've been fortunate enough to complete that vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Stop Resource Center assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises, including homelessness and addiction. Before its addition, Foster and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days, in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the new resource center, veterans in need are able to meet with any of First Stop's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit. They can receive assistance with housing, legal, medical care, employment, child care, education, pensions, food stamps and transportation needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of 'hurry up and wait,' \" Foster said. \"We want to centralize it. We want to get their needs addressed and ... get these service members back out into the community. That's what it's about.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Stop's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children. Set adjacent to the organization's original Stand Down House for male veterans, the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families. It is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,\" Foster said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Williams is First Stop's first female resident. An Operation Desert Storm veteran, Williams fell on hard times after losing her job last year. Now, she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My pride is restored,\" said Williams, 40. \"I'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am I going to go when I come home. It's just so much relief.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after Foster was announced as a Top 10 CNN Hero. A local veteran and recovering addict who was touched by Foster's story approached him with a donation that covered the first year's housing budget, about $44,000. The furnishings were donated by a local veterans' motorcycle club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Believe it, there are people in America that do care, and we were blessed to come across these individuals,\" Foster said. \"And the thing that I appreciate the most is it is done for veterans by veterans. ...

And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people.\n\nHowever, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security.\n\nIn this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority.\n\nTorture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America.\n\nFrom Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world.\n\nOnce permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib.\n\nYears later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well.\n\nTorture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, \"waterboarding is torture.\"\n\nAs we move forward, President Obama is wise to \"reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals\" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy.\n\nReclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called \"the dark side\" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues.\n\nHowever, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies.\n\nStill, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield.\n\nIn some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people.\n\nAnd even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life-and-death matters.\n\nBut the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever-greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic, from slavery to freedom, from sexism to suffrage, from stark poverty to shared prosperity. The president himself famously said, \"The union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.\"\n\nIt is true that today we face unprecedented, unorthodox, and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war.

In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nIn June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nCivilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.\n\n\n\nWhat started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry\n\n\n\nThe Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years.\n\n\n\nThe animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained.\n\n\n\nHours before the genocide\n\n\n\nIn early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos.\n\n\n\nSome have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Hutus and Tutsis\n\n\n\nThey speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of the genocide\n\n\n\nAfter 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide.\n\n\n\nAfter the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000.\n\n\n\nTrials for genocide suspects\n\n\n\nTop officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts.\n\n\n\nThe latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field.\n\n\n\nThe courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means \"open grass\" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice.\n\n\n\nState of the nation 15 years later\n\n\n\nRwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa.\n\n\n\nHowever, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "to sniff out cell phones.", "answer_start": "2868"}], "question": "What are training dogs for?", "id": "94", "answers": [{"text": "to sniff out cell phones.", "answer_start": "2868"}, {"text": "to sniff out cell phones.", "answer_start": "2868"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Where is Texas located?", "id": "27452274dc80afb4bb7a4d33eba67b62ff4NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity.

James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who heads up the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has refused to support the exemption, claiming the boat, with a steel hull but largely wooden superstructure, is a fire hazard.\n\n\n\n\n\nWebster, who says she is \"seething with anger\" about the complaint, said the ship is outfitted with state-of-the-art fire safety equipment and a full fire crew on board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The heat detectors are so sensitive in the rooms if you take a shower and forget to close your bathroom door, the heat detectors go off,\" Webster said. \"It's ridiculous.

But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is an electric vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display, titled \"The Energy and Environmental Showcase,\" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would like people to stop talking mpg,\" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ZENN\" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,\" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. \"Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads. But Stiller said the ZENN is a dramatic improvement in both safety and driveability, compared with the golf carts often seen around retirement communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the other alternative energy vehicles on display were cars from Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda and the Smart car company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother brand shown to lawmakers is named after Nikola Tesla, an inventor who helped develop the practical use of electricity a century ago. Tesla's system of alternating current eventually displaced Thomas Edison's use of direct current in the nation's early power grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red, two-seater electric sports car on display might have been a good fit for Tesla, a lifelong bachelor. Carper, the Delaware senator, suggested the two sports cars were classic \"chick magnets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla spokesman Joe Powers told CNN his company now has about 400 of the sleek, aerodynamic cars in private hands. \"We've created a viable car, and we came out with this model first to help draw attention to the Tesla brand,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California-based company also is developing a a sedan that will use the same advanced battery technology as the sports car, which costs about $109,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be the kind of car you can take on a trip, and carry four passengers and their luggage,\" Powers said. It uses 7,000 lithium-ion cells of the same chemistry now powering cell phones and laptop computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are working on a battery exchange program that will cut the cost of these vehicles by about $35,000,\" Powers said, describing a leasing program where owners can swap a used-up battery back for a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the vehicles on display qualify for a new $7,500 federal rebate intended to encourage car buyers to consider alternative-energy vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the vehicle that caused the most double-takes Tuesday was a bucket truck from the local electric utility company serving the Washington, D.C., area.

AOL Autos: Used Acura\n\n\n\nPriced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions.\n\n\n\n2007 Acura RDX\n\n\n\nA crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling) system.\n\n\n\n2006 & 2007 Acura TL\n\n\n\nA mid-size, front-wheel-drive, four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6, the Acura TL is a fine road machine. Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter. Depending on trim level, you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel.\n\n\n\n2007 Audi A3\n\n\n\nAudi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics, and that is evident here, in a sharply-engineered, handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride, nimble handling and zesty performance.\n\n\n\nThis sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in '07, and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox. AOL Autos: Used Audi\n\n\n\n2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series\n\n\n\nThe 3-Series is another winning stable of cars, but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family: The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible; the '06 325i RWD sedan; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4. Depending on the model year and version, the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L. AOL Autos: Used BMW\n\n\n\n2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35\n\n\n\nAnother of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years, the FX35 is one of the sportier editions. During these model years, the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive was standard, but AWD was also an option.\n\n\n\nSome spiffier features included leather seating surfaces, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti\n\n\n\nInfiniti G35\n\n\n\nThe G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road, offering Infiniti's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude. Yes, it has four doors, but it handles like a sporty coupe, with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6. Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual.\n\n\n\nLuxo amenities include leather upholstery, automatic climate control, steering wheel audio controls, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon headlamps.\n\n\n\nLexus\n\n\n\nAny luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed, high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market, and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models, to the '03-'04 GX edition, '03 LS, '04 / '06 IS entries, '04-'05 RX model, '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well, you get the picture.\n\n\n\nBottom line, given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability, it's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries. And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities. AOL Autos: Used Lexus\n\n\n\n2007 Lincoln MKX\n\n\n\nThis luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator, and made a big splash. A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge, it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny. Either FWD or AWD is available. One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the \"Vista Roof.\"\n\n\n\n2007 Lincoln MKZ\n\n\n\nAlso new for the '07 model year, this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr. Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, but AWD is optional. Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution.\n\n\n\n2007 Lincoln Town Car\n\n\n\nA venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back, the Town Car still \"has game\" -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s. It's still cavernous inside, but now boasts a much more refined design. It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that's linked to a four-speed automatic. The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques. Available in Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels, you can find one to fit any taste.\n\n\n\n1998 Porsche 911\n\n\n\nNo, your eyes don't deceive you -- CR did include a primo, high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $30,000. But, take note: This is the 1998 edition. But when you're dealing with quality of this level, even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it.\n\n\n\nSo, by \"going vintage,\" driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank. In '98, the 911 was powered by a 3.6L H-6 282 hp engine. So, while it wasn't quite the road-burner it is today, is still packed plenty of thrust.\n\n\n\n2007 Volvo S60 (FWD)\n\n\n\nOnly a year old, the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition, and it boasts top-drawer performance, stylish design and Volvo's all-world safety features. The '07 S60 came in several trim levels, with an array of engine sizes, from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies. Depending on the trim line, either a manual or automatic transmission can be had.\n\n\n\n2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70\n\n\n\nThe XC70 is a crossover vehicle, splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon. And it's one of the finest crossovers on the road. It's all-wheel drive, and the latest used-model-year, the '07, was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "12 hours in ", "answer_start": "1030"}], "question": "Women who don't conform will risk spending how long in jail?", "id": "5", "answers": [{"text": "12 hours in ", "answer_start": "1030"}, {"text": "12 hours ", "answer_start": "1030"}, {"text": "12 hours ", "answer_start": "1030"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "How long will women be in jail?", "id": "18858da55881a5e4d48bfd7f946b1b03547NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What colors must clothing be?", "id": "70944cd04679a84418bae199b4edcbdf668NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Women in Somalia's third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail.\n\n\n\n\n\nShabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote \"removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,\" the prime minister said. \"I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn't have to be that way, cutting hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and it backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Moody and sinister, ", "answer_start": "1000"}], "question": "What type is Chuck Bass?", "id": "721", "answers": [{"text": "Moody and sinister, ", "answer_start": "1000"}, {"text": "Moody and sinister, ", "answer_start": "1000"}, {"text": "(\"Gossip Girl\"): ", "answer_start": "903"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(The Frisky) -- Don't you just hate the type of person who smugly informs you, \"I don't watch TV,\" like that's something to be proud of? They think they're so great with all their fancy book learning.\n\n\n\nWhat they don't realize is that TV isn't for dummies -- there's tons of educational programming available -- you just need to know what to watch. I mean, you can learn your ABCs with \"Sesame Street's\" Grover, how to make gnocchi with Mario Batali, and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on HGTV.\n\n\n\nTelevision is also a great romance resource. Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the years -- Lucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag ... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example. It's also a good place to learn which type of guy you should avoid.\n\n\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\n\nChuck Bass (\"Gossip Girl\"): Few men can pull off lavender argyle, but Chuck Bass is definitely one of them. Moody and sinister, when Chuck Bass Types (CBTs) like you, it's as though you've been inducted into a secret society of two.\n\n\n\nIt's you against the world and the CBT will bring out a dark side you might not have even realized you possessed. Whip smart with a caustic wit, he'll charm you all the while tucking away your secrets for use at a later date. And use them he will. Because when a CBT tires of you, he won't just say \"see ya,\" he'll decimate you.\n\n\n\nHank Moody (\"Californication\"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase. Exhibit A is Hank Moody. Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age.\n\n\n\nOf course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional.\n\n\n\nVince Chase (\"Entourage\"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like \"Medellin,\" can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group.\n\n\n\nOn the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly. Vince might be fun for a fling, but forget about bringing him home to mama.\n\n\n\nDon Draper (\"Mad Men\"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering?\n\n\n\nMad Men's smokin' hot Don Draper actually is mysterious (and smoldering!), so I don't know what point I was trying to make (because I'm all distracted from the photos on his IMDB page)... oh, wait! The point I'm trying to make is that while Draper is indeed mysterious, he's also a liar, a cheat and a cad. So if a DDT tries to slip you his number, just say no and send it to me. What?

His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.\n\n\n\nKenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison.\n\n\n\nTrapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.\n\n\n\nBrown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.\n\n\n\n\"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.\n\n\n\n\"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.\n\n\n\nThe inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.\n\n\n\n\"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"\n\n\n\nThere is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.\n\n\n\nMeditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.\n\n\n\n\"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.\n\n\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.\n\n\n\nFor the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.\n\n\n\nSome inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.\n\n\n\nBuddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.\n\n\n\nSome inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.\n\n\n\nThe practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.\n\n\n\nOne inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary \"The Dhamma Brothers,\" said Vipassana was harder than the 8\u00bd years he had spent on death row. More than 120 men in Donaldson have gone through Vipassana at least once.  Watch a clip of \"The Dhamma Brothers\" \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"They don't feel so close to exploding,\" said Jenny Phillips, director of the film. \"They aren't afraid to have conversations with people and to express themselves. They aren't always on edge.\"\n\n\n\nCritics, including some prison officials, doubt that meditation works. They worry that it may be a tactic to convince parole boards to lighten a sentence.\n\n\n\nIn areas that are heavily Christian, some wardens are uncomfortable with introducing Eastern religions. Alabama prison authorities were initially skeptical about meditation but next year will designate an open dormitory for inmates going through Vipassana, said Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment for the Alabama Department of Corrections.\n\n\n\nHe said corrections officers have seen lower levels of violence among Donaldson inmates who meditate.\n\n\n\nIn California, a state where the swollen prison population has resulted in dangerously overcrowded prisons, teaching conflict management is critical, said Anne Seisen Saunders, a Zen Buddhist instructor who was raised Christian.\n\n\n\nHer Prison Meditation Project, based near San Diego, began a decade ago in one prison yard. Today, the program has expanded to five prisons, with an average of 20 inmates participating in each location.\n\n\n\nLast week, the autumn sky transformed from a deep purple to light blue outside Kenneth Brown's meager studio apartment. Inside, Brown sat on his bed, barefoot and deep in concentration, in front of a makeshift altar holding books a photo of the Buddha. Traces of incense billowed in the air.\n\n\n\nBrown, now 62, resides in Georgia to be near his family. He says he was wrongfully convicted of arson. In 2005, a Massachusetts appeals judge reduced his sentence from 20 years to nine.\n\n\n\nHis body was motionless, his eyes closed and the palms of his hands facing upward.\n\n\n\nThese days, Brown's practice of mediation helps him tackle the challenges of being unemployed with a felony record. The college graduate has been rejected from jobs catching stray dogs and cleaning hotel rooms.\n\n\n\nBut he's got a lot to be thankful for: His daughters, his grandchildren -- and meditation, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I finally feel at peace.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"The Lost Symbol,\" ", "answer_start": "137"}], "question": "what is borwns new novel", "id": "1115", "answers": [{"text": "\"The Lost Symbol,\" ", "answer_start": "137"}, {"text": "\"The Lost Symbol,\" ", "answer_start": "137"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what is another book to mivue", "id": "322aa8c2cb9acc9435ab828a6c0fbbfd3ffNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" has spawned a raft of imitators, most of which pale in comparison; the latest, \"The Lost Symbol,\" is by Brown himself.\n\n\n\nDan Brown's \"The Lost Symbol\" is his first novel since the blockbuster \"The Da Vinci Code\" in 2003.\n\n\n\nOnce again, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to the scene of a gruesome attack, joins forces with an attractive and erudite love interest, and speeds around a world capital chasing clues, solving puzzles, and risking his life while dropping cocktail parties' worth of scholarly minutiae. Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThis time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\n\n\nOur hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nThat secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.\n\n\n\nBut for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)\n\n\n\nEven after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative. Sometimes it seems that authors, like their villains, don't know when to leave well enough alone.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: C+\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "heavy flannel or wool ", "answer_start": "1637"}], "question": "What is the 19th century bikini made of?", "id": "947", "answers": [{"text": "heavy flannel or wool ", "answer_start": "1637"}, {"text": "heavy flannel or wool ", "answer_start": "1637"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What did Bryan Hyland?", "id": "197aa7cc7ab99b84612b68498bc2c60e3b8NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(MentalFloss.com) -- 1.

Tapping into the worldwide obsession with nuclear physics, he named his tiny invention the \"atom.\" A few months later, another French designer, Louis Reard, one-upped Heim, revealing an even tinier suit, which he dubbed the \"bikini\" after Bikini Atoll, the island in the Pacific where the U.S. had tested the atom bomb. The new swimsuit, it was said, was as small as an atom and just as powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

In 2009, Americans spent $4.3 billion -- roughly $400 million more than the GDP of Barbados -- on swimwear alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The 19th-century version of a bikini was made out of either heavy flannel or wool -- fabrics that would not be transparent when wet -- and covered the entire body from neck to toe. The suits were so heavy that women had to hold onto ropes strung from the beach to offshore buoys to keep from sinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The bikini rocketed to fame in 1960 with Brian Hyland's hit single, \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" The famous 30 inches of fabric didn't debut on the cover of Sports Illustrated until 1964.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 25 brand names mistakenly used as generic terms\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,\" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdm. Patrick M. Walsh, vice chief of naval operations, said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must eliminate the perceived stigma, shame and dishonor of asking for help,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. James F. Amos, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention \"at all levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines. He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Gen. William M. Fraser, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, said his branch, too, was taking steps \"to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the efforts have not sufficed. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. \"What's going on?\" he asked rhetorically.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe panel members made clear that, whatever is going on, it is complex. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"some kind of relationship problem,\" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"were a real strain\" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts. Maj. Gen. David A. Rubenstein, deputy surgeon general of the Army, cited the case of a 33-year-old soldier who was living at home with his wife and three children.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe suffered a traumatic brain injury more than two years ago and had been giving weekly motivational speeches to other soldiers in a clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past two years, the soldier also had been seeing a psychiatrist. The most recent visit occurred last Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, he saw his primary care doctor and his nurse case manager, and also had a life-skills appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On Tuesday, he apparently committed suicide,\" Rubenstein said. \"This soldier was treated, compliant and supported in every way, and yet he's dead today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe suicide underscores that suicide is \"a complex, very difficult problem that causes all of us to scratch our heads and wonder: how do we stop the next one?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, two cadets and two members of the staff and faculty killed themselves, said Brig. Gen. Michael S. Linnington, commandant of the cadets.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited stress from broken relationships and, in one case, a pre-existing mental health condition that academy officials had not known about at the time of admission. None of the four had been deployed to a combat zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinnington called the spate of self-directed violence at the school \"troubling and unacceptable\" and said preventive measures there had been beefed up in recent months."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"Body Works\" ", "answer_start": "150"}], "question": "What is the name of the exhibit?", "id": "364", "answers": [{"text": "\"Body Works\" ", "answer_start": "150"}, {"text": "\"Body Works\" ", "answer_start": "150"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- A controversial exhibition featuring preserved corpses having sex opened Thursday in Germany's capital.\n\n\n\nGunther von Hagens' controversial \"Body Works\" shows have traveled throughout the world.\n\n\n\nPart of his traveling \"Body Works\" exhibition, \"The Cycle of Life,\" is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections.\n\n\n\nIn one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head.\n\n\n\nTorsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself.\n\n\n\nHe said: \"As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway.\"\n\n\n\nConceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination.\n\n\n\nThis process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics.\n\n\n\nOn his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal \"to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life.\" What do you think?\n\n\n\nHe added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the \"benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body.\"\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that \"death and sex are both taboo topics.

This year, the Turkish military chief of staff was among the key speakers attending the conference. But Gen. Ilker Basbug reportedly told the audience of dignitaries in Washington this week that the ongoing presence of PKK rebels in Northern Iraq continues to have a negative impact on Turkish-U.S. relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Turks say they are still waiting to see to whether the Obama White House's change in tone will translate to a change in the U.S. government's deeply unpopular foreign policy in the Middle East.

For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"\n\n\n\nI was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.\n\n\n\nThe following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood.\n\n\n\nBut it was harder for my parents. Because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble.\n\n\n\nCNN: What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: I lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, I was drowning many times throughout the experience. There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. That's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time.\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about your foundation, Happy Hearts?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Happy Hearts is a foundation that I established after the tsunami. It helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. We build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. The education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. We help over 23,000 children a year. We give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. The schools elevate the whole community.\n\n\n\nAfter the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in Indonesia. We work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that's something incredible because it really changed so many lives.\n\n\n\nOur other project is in Peru, where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year.\n\n\n\nCNN: If you only had 24 hours in Prague, what would you do?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: First of all I would take my friends and family and I would walk around and go to the Charles Bridge because that is my favorite place. Then I would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist. And then I would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the Musical House. In the evening I may go to a typical Czech pub and afterwards for a concert because I really love them; they put my mind at ease and inspire me.\n\n\n\nCNN: How creative is the city?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers. But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. That's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors. That's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden. Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U.S. was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music. I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies.\n\n\n\nCNN: If Prague were a person, who would it be?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: I think Prague would be our former president Vaclav Havel.

The first thing to say is, \"Well, about time.\"\n\n\n\nOn the ground you've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the American effort. But by and large, to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich.\n\n\n\nI mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006. And this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in Baghdad and by [U.S.] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad himself. That's what broke the back of al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThen when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.\n\n\n\nRoberts: So it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here, but was that the only thing that worked? What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?\n\n\n\nWare: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.\n\n\n\nWhat it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia. And primarily it's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the Sunni insurgents and many members of al Qaeda. That's what's brought down the violence. This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.\n\n\n\nSo if there's new teams out there with new technology, great.

He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him.\n\n\n\nNot a good idea for either of them, as it turns out.\n\n\n\nHalloween is nearly upon us, but \"Antichrist\" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act.\n\n\n\nThe movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\n\n\n\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\n\n\n\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\n\n\n\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\n\n\n\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\n\n\n\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked \"You get what you pay for, folks\" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end.\n\n\n\nThat unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more.\n\n\n\nBeautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, \"Antichrist\" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox.\n\n\n\n\"Antichrist\" is not rated and runs 104 minutes.

Most people don't realize how fast the time goes, but I turned those questions on myself.\"\n\n\n\nThough he quickly points out that he didn't dwell on those questions, Ripken admits it got him thinking, and eventually planning, so that when retirement came in 2001, the shift from baseball to business was easy.\n\n\n\n\"From the outside, I'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that I had another thing to go into,\" he said. \"I had prepared for what was next.\"\n\n\n\nThese days, five seasons after retiring from a 21-year career he spent with the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is a businessman, team owner, radio-show host and author.

Phillips.\n\n\n\nThe book, available April 10, was born out a speech Ripken gave about the \"secrets\" of his success. Writing it turned out to be an emotional journey, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I got to reflect on what my parents had taught me, the values and principles, right and wrong,\" Ripken said. \"It's good to be in touch with those things.\"\n\n\n\nThe fact is, whether in baseball or business, Ripken rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father, Cal Sr., a former player and manager. The book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field.\n\n\n\nNow 46, Ripken is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, and his brother, Bill, a former teammate, is executive vice president. The company owns minor league teams in Aberdeen and in Augusta, Georgia. The brothers also have co-written two books on baseball and co-host a baseball call-in show on weekends on XM Radio.\n\n\n\nThere were reports in December that Ripken was heading a group that was interested in buying the Orioles, but Baltimore owner Peter Angelos denied that claim.\n\n\n\n\"There is no question that Cal and I have a great relationship,\" Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun. \"He was a great player for the Orioles, and I have an affection for him.

Richard Phillips since Wednesday, the company said in a written statement issued at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nPhillips has not been hurt, the statement said.\n\nPhillips, who has received provisions and batteries for his radio, has been in touch with the crews of the Alabama and the Bainbridge, the statement said.\n\nThe pirates are the same four men who hijacked Phillips' vessel, the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, early Wednesday hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe Alabama's 20-person crew later regained control of the ship, which is owned and operated by the Norfolk-based Maersk Line Ltd.\n\nIn a written statement, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers noted that \"there have been many questions about how the crew re-captured the ship and how the captain came to leave the ship.\"\n\nBut he would not clarify the matter.\n\n\"Our immediate focus has been to bring the current situation to a safe resolution,\" he said. \"There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full de-briefing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Navy, which is in charge of the situation, requested the help of the FBI. FBI negotiators in the United States are in touch with the crew of the Bainbridge, which arrived on the scene earlier Thursday to assist, a senior U.S. defense official said.\n\nAccording to Maersk's last communication with the Navy, the 28-foot lifeboat was disabled and \"dead in the water,\" Speers said Thursday morning.\n\n\"We are encouraged that most of the crew is safe. They have been resilient and courageous throughout this crisis,\" Speers said. \"But we will remain on watch, staffing our situation room and our family hot line until this situation is resolved and the captain is safely returned.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Maersk Alabama resumed its journey to Mombasa, Kenya, with an 18-person armed security detail on board, according to Joseph Murphy, the father of the ship's first officer.

Mike Mullen, gave some of the deploying Marines an impassioned speech about what they will face.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have a lot of time. The slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction, and it has picked up, three years, each year to a significant degree,\" Mullen said, describing the deteriorating security situation.\n\n\n\n\"I believe the strategy that the president laid out, the decision that he's made, is the right decision. Both those are right, and we will now move out, given our orders, and we'll carry them out. And again, I couldn't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that,\" he told the hundreds of Marines in attendance.\n\n\n\nMany of the Marines there are young and are facing their first combat deployment. Although all the bravado of a newly minted Marine ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight, their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to Mullen.\n\n\n\n\"Best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself, that you're not going to freeze up,\" Lance Cpl. Matthew Jenkins said after Mullen's speech.\n\n\n\n\"We'll see how I react when it goes down in a couple weeks,\" said Lance Cpl. Joshua Williamson.\n\n\n\nQuestions remain, however, about how so many Marines without combat experience in Afghanistan can jump into a heated combat zone.\n\n\n\nMullen admitted some concerns.\n\n\n\n\"We're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that. I understand that, but I have a huge amount of confidence in our Marine Corps based on their ability to adapt, what they did in Iraq,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere seems to be little worry among unit leaders in the 3/2nd LAR, who have been training and watching their troops grow in skills and confidence in recent months.\n\n\n\n\"One thing about the Marine Corps is that you always have experience wherever you go,\" Auer said.\n\n\n\n\"So we've got Marines that have done deployments before and the training they have given me, I'm confident to where I can lead my platoon, but I'm also relying on staff NCOs (non-commissioned officers) that have years of experience.\n\n\n\n\"That experience we have from the different deployments in Iraq, I'm relying on all the NCOs to carry their weight, and with that I don't think there is anything that can get in our way,\" Auer continued.\n\n\n\nFor the families of these Marines, deployments are never easy, especially when they know that their husbands and wives are moving to a region known for its hostility.\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad he's going where he's needed. It would be a waste for him to go where he's not needed and not be able to do his job,\" said Kim Durbin, wife of deploying Marine Lt. Dan Durbin.\n\n\n\n\"It's just not him in the Marine Corps, it's our family, and we are proud to be a part of it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nKim Durbin and her three kids, ages 1, 3 and 5, will watch Dan Durbin leave for Helmand province on his first combat deployment in a few weeks.\n\n\n\nShe appears strong for a young mother, but all the preparations a family does can sometimes bury reality.\n\n\n\n\"Well we're thankful he's going to be with us for Christmas, so we just want to enjoy the time we have together.\"\n\n\n\nBut Kim Durbin's eyes close, and she fights back tears that become a sob.\n\n\n\n\"I think when we actually say goodbye, it's going to be hard, but we'll get through it, and we want to enjoy the time we do have together,\" she said.\n\n\n\nFamilies on this base are their own support system. Wives of Marines with husbands who have deployed numerous times help younger families get through the first deployments.\n\n\n\n\"It's very difficult, I think, for people outside the military community to understand what they have to go through,\" said Marine Capt. Eric Maedor, who returned from his third combat deployment to Afghanistan weeks ago.\n\n\n\nHis wife, Teresa Maedor, a veteran of keeping the family together while Eric is away, agrees.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think when you have 'X' number of deployments under your belt that it makes it any easier; you just know what to expect. You know what to expect next time as far as how you need to manage things. Sometimes you worry about them more; sometimes you worry about them less,\" she said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "our sincerity ", "answer_start": "939"}], "question": "What was conveyed?", "id": "35", "answers": [{"text": "sincerity ", "answer_start": "943"}, {"text": "our sincerity ", "answer_start": "939"}], "validated_answers": "{\"939:953\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Are the safety issues going to be resolved?", "id": "69a14baddaa1f749bea15949200b4a7e19NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Is he confident that their sincerity was conveyed?", "id": "1494dc24b1d46c24476bf5a1b3ec8adee37NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- The president of Toyota said he takes full responsibility for safety issues in the company's cars and vowed to regain the trust of customers in his first interview after appearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is I, the chief executive officer, the one on the very top, should be responsible for this,\" Akio Toyoda told CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"I would like to really listen to the customers' voices, and together with the dealership, distributor, suppliers, we need to work together, and we would like to work together and to strive for regaining the trust once again from our customers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nToyoda appeared earlier before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in a hearing aimed at discovering, among other things, why the automaker was slow to respond to safety issues related to sudden acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe admitted to King that the day had been difficult, \"and I am not confident to what degree our sincerity was conveyed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked what his grandfather, the company founder, would say, Toyoda responded, \"He is telling me to regain the trust of those customers who are driving our vehicles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe vowed to respond more quickly to any future problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he was adamant that the company's products are roadworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to say that Toyota vehicles are safe,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany engineers were not able to reproduce the throttle-control problems, he said, \"so, at this point in time, I would say our vehicles are safe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nToyoda told King he is dedicated to getting back to the basics of the company in providing reliable, high-quality cars to its customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since I became a president last year in July, I have been sending the messages to all our employees to make better vehicles so that our customers would be very happy to ride our vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And we would like to maintain this,\" he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "flight ", "answer_start": "108"}], "question": "Who was told to change course prior to crash?", "id": "918", "answers": [{"text": "flight ", "answer_start": "108"}, {"text": "the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines ", "answer_start": "73"}, {"text": "flight ", "answer_start": "108"}, {"text": "pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines ", "answer_start": "77"}, {"text": "flight ", "answer_start": "108"}, {"text": "the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines ", "answer_start": "73"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Air traffic controllers in Lebanon were telling the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines flight to change course shortly before it crashed into the sea, the country's transportation minister told CNN Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn international search team was combing Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline for signs of life Tuesday amid fears that all 90 people aboard the Addis Ababa-bound airliner perished in the accident, authorities said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanese Transportation Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said Tuesday it was too early to determine whether pilot error had caused the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would need to be recovered to determine why Flight 409 disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport at about 2:30 a.m. local time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe control tower lost contact with the plane before it made a course correction Monday, al-Aridi said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of the flight had more than 20 years of experience flying various aircraft with the airline's network.

We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget watching him on \"Oprah\" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest.\n\n\n\n\n\nA panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht, wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket, according to police reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autopsy report showed the actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,\" said Lana Wood, refering to theories that the actress voluntarily jumped from the boat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just want the truth to come out, the real story,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his long silence with a detailed account of that day in \"Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,\" a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request.\n\n\n\n\n\nWood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California and they invited Wood's \"Brainstorm\" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous over Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner admitted his jealousy in his book \"Pieces of My Heart,\" also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbarrassed, Davern said he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. \"They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off.\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing.

He denied the security services paid him to change his story.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip.\n\n\n\nHe no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash.\n\n\n\n\"I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,\" Rees testified. \"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2000, Rees published a book, \"The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,\" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England.\n\n\n\nRees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills.\n\n\n\nDuring the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories.\n\n\n\nIn the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, \"Dodi\" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car.\n\n\n\nLawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory.\n\n\n\n\"He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,\" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot.\n\n\n\nRees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: \"I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's my last true memory.\"\n\n\n\nRees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler's in Monte Carlo to buy an engagement ring in late August 1997 were untrue.\n\n\n\nBritish authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died, but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt.\n\n\n\nAlthough Diana and Dodi Fayed died in Paris, a British coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Britain. The inquest does not involve driver Henri Paul because his body remained in France.\n\n\n\nBritish authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after French authorities concluded their investigation, which lasted from August 1997 to late 2003. The inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that British police could do their own report, which was needed for the British inquest.\n\n\n\nThe British police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006. The inquest then resumed in October 2007 and is expected to last four to six months.

Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.\n\n\n\nOthers wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nClearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.\n\n\n\nSomalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.\n\n\n\nBarre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.\n\n\n\nDuring the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.\n\n\n\nOur fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThe 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.\n\n\n\nAs recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.\n\n\n\nNo matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.\n\n\n\nThese environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\nFaced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.\n\n\n\nGiven the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region. In a worst-case scenario, the region could become an incubator for terrorist cells or a depot for training international jihadists -- if it hasn't already.\n\n\n\nResolving this problem will likely involve precisely the kind of nation-building the United States once disdained and are now engaged in with Afghanistan. They amount to the back-end costs of the Cold War.\n\n\n\nThese pirates are not romantic heroes and their actions have generated an entirely different set of problems in Somalia, but they have our attention. In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes.\n\n\n\nWe should also know that part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes. Extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong, but by ignoring the dumping of nuclear waste and the threats to the regional food supply, we effectively created a niche for these pirates. And Capt. Phillips' ordeal is a clear signal that humanitarian concerns are not the soft aspects of foreign policy, but rather the key to protecting our national interests abroad.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Jelani Cobb."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "133 ", "answer_start": "200"}], "question": "How many cases have been reported in 26 states", "id": "778", "answers": [{"text": "133 ", "answer_start": "200"}, {"text": "133 ", "answer_start": "200"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "The outbreak is not over, but new cases", "id": "226b4f305419a074aa58def289f2679a324NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 133 people in 26 states have been infected, according to the CDC.

Martin Luther King Jr. led the civil rights movement, \"Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took a president to get it done.\"  Watch what Clinton says about Obama, King and the civil rights movement \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nSome African-American leaders criticized the remarks as dismissive of the civil rights movement and of King, who was assassinated in 1968. On Sunday, Obama described Clinton's comments as \"ill-advised\" but rejected any suggestion that his campaign has been behind the complaints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For them to somehow suggest that we're interjecting race as a consequence of a statement she made, that we haven't commented on, is pretty hard to figure out,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the third leading Democrat, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, said Clinton was suggesting \"that real change ... came not through the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King but through a Washington politician.\" Edwards won the South Carolina primary in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Clinton said Obama's backers were distorting her remarks and called King \"one of the people I admire most in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Sunday, at the Presbyterian church, Clinton said it was \"historic\" that both a black man and a woman were serious contenders for the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am so proud of my party.

Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia.\n\nHapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said.\n\nBoth the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks.\n\nLast week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\" when traveling through the area.\n\n-- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "prepare the New York Times Square ball Thursday for the event's 100th anniversary.\n", "answer_start": "214"}], "question": "What was the meeting about?", "id": "1441", "answers": [{"text": "prepare the New York Times Square ball Thursday for the event's 100th anniversary.\n", "answer_start": "214"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2, \"bad_question\": 1}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what was the energy saving difference?", "id": "5747d16773512e46d993afc49153fb2106NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What issues is Palin thinking about?", "id": "6293b02369ec9b3478297d78a925f564429NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What was McCain's choice?", "id": "7102e05d80eecd040f89a4e5069c526ccf4NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "was it cool to be there?", "id": "73835bc331cdba1457c81d8eea6d49e7896NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York celebrates the centennial of its most famous New Year's tradition Monday, as organizers of the Times Square ball drop have given the crystal globe an environmental makeover.\n\nTechnicians prepare the New York Times Square ball Thursday for the event's 100th anniversary.\n\nThis year the 1,415-pound ball has been outfitted with more than 9,500 energy-efficient light-emitting diodes that will illuminate the ball's more than 600 crystals. The LEDs will use the same amount of electricity as about 10 toasters, say event officials.\n\nThat's a dramatic overhaul from 1907's first Times Square ball, which was made from iron and wood and was covered with about 100 light bulbs.  Watch the computer-controlled ball \u00bb\n\nNew York police estimate about a million people will crowd Times Square to watch the ball drop from a flagpole atop the One Times Square building at midnight.\n\nAnother billion people worldwide are expected to watch the spectacle on video, said Tom Chiodo, a spokesman for the Times Square Alliance. Of those viewers, 100 million will be in the United States, he said.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be joined by Iraq war veteran Karolina Wierzchowska, who was also a Ground Zero guard worker and a New York Police Academy valedictorian -- to push the button for the ball drop at 11:59 p.m.\n\nWeather forecasts indicate clear skies for the celebration, with temperatures in the 40s -- a mild departure from inclement weather gripping much of the Northeast.\n\nIn an effort to help people stay warm, New York City sanitation workers will be passing out \"goody bags\" from the Times Square Alliance that will include mittens and hats, said Chiodo.\n\nThe event will include musical performances from Hannah Montana, the Jonas Brothers, Kid Rock, Lenny Kravitz, Lifehouse, The Bravery, and alums from Fox TV's \"American Idol,\" Carrie Underwood, Jordin Sparks and Blake Lewis.\n\nSecurity inside Times Square will be tight and everyone should expect to have their bags searched at least three times, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\nIn addition to a heavy police presence on the ground, Kelly said the NYPD's counterterrorism unit, radiation detectors and helicopters will also be patrolling the crowds.\n\nKelly said that once the Times Square attendees pass the entrance gates, they will not be able to leave.\n\nNew York's terrorist threat level remains at orange -- the nation's second highest level -- as it has since the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\"We certainly haven't let our guard down,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs the ball drops, the new year will be greeted with a massive fireworks explosion, some 168 shots in the first five seconds alone, and a downpour of two tons of fireproof confetti. Some of the confetti includes New Year's wishes that were written by visitors to the city in nearly two dozen languages.\n\nOver the past week, visitors from across the country wrote their messages on a Times Square \"Wishing Wall.\"\n\n\"I want to turn the world green and the water clean,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Let my husband stop snoring,\" another wrote, while others were more serious: \"That my mom will get her kidney transplant\" and \"Peace in Pakistan.\" E-mail to a friend"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "many different ", "answer_start": "216"}], "question": "What background is her family from?", "id": "223", "answers": [{"text": "many different ", "answer_start": "216"}, {"text": "Muslim ", "answer_start": "2037"}, {"text": "many different ", "answer_start": "216"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "New York (CNN) -- Miss USA Rima Fakih is a Muslim with Lebanese heritage, but her family is \"not defined by religion,\" Fakih said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm an American girl,\" Fakih said. \"And just to be clear, my family comes from many different backgrounds and religions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newest Miss USA, crowned last weekend, was interviewed Wednesday for HLN's \"The Joy Behar Show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFakih downplayed the significance of photographs that emerged online this week showing her dancing against a stripper's pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone took them as if I was stripping, which to be honest with you was just a competition,\" she said. \"It was more of an event held by a radio station.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS JUST IN: Is Miss USA a Muslim trailblazer?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Detroit, Michigan, radio station promotion held three years ago was like a class to help women \"learn how to dance and feel sexy,\" she told Behar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photos show her dancing in short pants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To be extra funny, because I'm known to be silly, I put money in my bra,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe controversy, however, has made her name a top search term on the internet, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm the number one person on Yahoo or Google, I heard,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheesecake photos helped last year's Miss USA runner-up, Carrie Prejean, become well known, but she was eventually stripped of her Miss California crown when racier images emerged.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehar asked Fakih if there were any such photos of her that might eventually surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" she said. \"I've always been known to be very respectful to my family and my reputation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stripper pole photos did not upset her family, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're very proud of me,\" she said. \"They take it as if I'm not up there for beauty, or to pose in a bathing suit, but for something more significant -- for being beautiful on the inside, for being wise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFakih was born in Lebanon, but her family moved to New York when she was young.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nCARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The U.N. General Assembly is in session, and so is this edition of CNN Student News. Bringing you today's commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: Leaders Talk Climate Change\n\n\n\nAZUZ: First up, representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in New York to talk about global issues. This is called the United Nations General Assembly, and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year. One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change. Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century. He's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to climate change.\n\n\n\nDuring speeches yesterday, President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases, pledged to try to reduce them. Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this, but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently, but Obama is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution. He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two.\n\n\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Despite all the mistrust, we have to find a way forward. We have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of Israelis and Palestinians in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering.\n\n\n\nSpoken Word\n\n\n\nSONNY PERDUE, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: This has been a 48-hour ordeal that people had been, stayed here and to care for the safety of people. I just want to thank them. I want to thank those firefighters and first responders all across Georgia, from the east and Stevens county, to the west in Paulding and Carroll and Douglas, and in Cherokee in northwest Georgia. This has been a huge effort.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Flooding\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Okay, that was Georgia's Gov. Sonny Perdue there, talking about severe flooding that has led to at least eight deaths. Noting that nearly all of those were from drivers and passengers who were swept away by floodwaters, Gov. Perdue pleaded with residents to stay off the roads until the waters recede. Yesterday, he planned to ask President Obama to declare a federal emergency in order to free up money that would help with the relief efforts. With flash flood watches stretching across parts of the southeastern U.S., Rob Marciano examines the impact of this severe weather.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It's a cruel irony. After months of drought, heavy rains spawning deadly floods. Across much of the southeast, streets are covered. Homes are destroyed. Tranquil creeks now on a rampage. In some places near Atlanta, nearly two feet of rain fell.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the highest water that I've seen, and I've been living around here all my life.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: This couple was rescued by boat in the pitch black. They had to use flashlights to see. And the only thing they could bring with them: their dog and a few family treasures.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are my wedding pictures.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: But they were luckier than others, others who lost something so much more dear. In Georgia, right now, 17 counties under a state of emergency. Officials say they're in rescue and recovery mode, but those rescues, especially around Atlanta, have been slow and difficult.\n\n\n\nPictures showing just how crippled some areas of the city are. In the western suburb of Powder Springs, a house is left to burn. Next to it, a fire truck stranded, helpless in the rising floodwaters. These two men had to get around on inflatable mattresses, and so many people are stunned by what they're seeing.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now, shock. I don't think it's really set in that this is real. This is, we're flooded out. We don't have a home.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: Rob Marciano, CNN, Austell, Georgia.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nAZUZ: For another perspective, look at this! This is the amusement park, Six Flags over Georgia and under water. It's located west of Atlanta, and what you're seeing here is a coaster called the Scream Machine. I think I've ridden this thing every time I've been to Six Flags. From the looks of it, I won't be doing that again anytime soon. Amazing pictures.\n\n\n\nImpact Your World\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Obviously, the relief efforts are going to be going on for a while. Several organizations are already at work.

Me\n\n\n\nMICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a Central American nation located between Guatemala and Nicaragua. I gained my independence from Spain in 1821. My capital city is Tegucigalpa. I'm Honduras, and I'm home to about 7.8 million people.\n\n\n\nOusted President\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Political turmoil has led to clashes in that capital city, all based around Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya. He was actually removed from office back in June and faces charges of violating the country's constitution. Zelaya, who's in the white hat in the middle of your screen here, returned to Honduras Monday. He took up refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. If he leaves, the Honduran government says it will arrest him. The Brazilian embassy isn't considered part of Honduras, so Zelaya can't be arrested as long as he stays inside. Police and soldiers positioned outside the embassy clashed with Zelaya's supporters before clearing the area yesterday. The situation has led the U.S. to close its embassy in the Honduran capital.\n\n\n\nTroops in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Meantime, the president of Afghanistan says he supports a top U.S. commander's call to increase the number of U.S. troops in the Asian country. President Hamid Karzai called it \"the right approach.\" But it's certainly not the only one. As Barbara Starr explains, there are several ideas on how to fight the war in Afghanistan, and who that war should be against.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nBARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: As violence increases daily in Afghanistan, some are calling for a major troop build-up. The president signaling when he ordered a review of the Afghan war, he wasn't anxious to quickly send tens of thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban insurgency.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Let's do a soup-to-nuts re-evaluation, focusing on what our original goal was, which was to get al Qaeda, the people who killed 3,000 Americans.\n\n\n\nSTARR: Attacking al Qaeda is fundamentally a counter-terrorism strategy, requiring a limited number of new troops. It's the \"Plan B\" advocated by some in the White House, according to a senior Pentagon official. But Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top commander, is still calling for a counterinsurgency strategy to strengthen Afghanistan to the point the Taliban have no safe haven there. That could take tens of thousands of more troops beyond the 68,000 now planned. Retired Gen. Montgomery Meigs says it's a must.\n\n\n\nGEN. MONTGOMERY MEIGS (RET.), U.S. ARMY: If you're going to get the tribes over on your side and the side of government, you have to have enough people there to make things happen for them, economically, socially and in terms of security.\n\n\n\nSTARR: Could the Pentagon put U.S. firepower, such as fighter jets and drones, in neighboring countries to reduce the U.S. presence inside Afghanistan?\n\n\n\nMEIGS: My point is, if you don't have the kind of intelligence you need to make those systems effective, you are going to swing and miss a lot.\n\n\n\nSTARR: The powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Service committee says more U.S. troops right away are not the answer for another reason.\n\n\n\nSEN. CARL LEVIN (D-MI), CHAIRMAN, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I've been recommending to the president that, first of all, before any consideration is made of additional combat forces, that we get the Afghan army bigger, better equipped.\n\n\n\nSTARR: The new bottom line? Support for the war in Afghanistan is declining, and the president and his commanders will have to make the case for whatever comes next. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nPromo\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Afghanistan, Honduras, the southeastern U.S.: Today's show is all over the map.

At the end of a recent high school game in Missouri, Matt Ziesel took a handoff and hightailed it all the way to the end zone, scoring his team's only touchdown of the day. So, why is this noteworthy? Well, Matt has Down Syndrome, a genetic disorder. He's always dreamed of scoring a TD. So, with the clock winding down and his team down 46-0, Matt's coach wanted to give him that chance. He talked to the other team's coach, who agreed to give up the shutout and let Matt score.\n\n\n\nGoodbye\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Great story. We'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Would you give up a shutout to help someone out? Would you have done it for Matt Ziesel? Head to our blog at CNNStudentnews.com and share your opinions.

CNN looks at some of the scientific discoveries that changed the world.\n\n\n\nHIV was isolated by scientists in 1983 and named in 1986 by an international committee\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF HIV/ AIDS\n\n\n\nOriginally called slimmer's disease, as sufferers lost a lot of weight, the first recorded case of HIV occurred in the Congo in 1977. After several infections, a Danish doctor died of pneumonia, which normally doesn't break through the body's immune system. The components of her disease had not yet been placed together, indicating that this was a new form of illness.\n\n\n\nOther cases spread in following years around Africa and in homosexual men in New York and San Francisco. By 1980, 55 American men had been diagnosed with the disease. Research began in Europe, the U.S. and Africa to ascertain what this new disease could be.\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control found that the disease was caused by a virus being passed around by bodily fluids such as semen or blood. In 1981 it published its findings, saying the disease attacked T-cells, which help the body fight infection.\n\n\n\nBy 1983 the disease was isolated by teams of American and French researchers. In 1986 an international committee decided the virus should be called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n\n\nEducation campaigns were unrolled around the world, advising people to avoid risky sexual behavior or sharing needles.\n\n\n\nBy June 1990, 139,765 people had the disease, with a 60 per cent mortality rate. The progress of the disease slowed down in the West with education campaigns and the development of protease inhibitors, which provided sufferers with almost complete remission. But in Africa, the spread and treatment of HIV remains a global concern.\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF LITHIUM TO TREAT MOOD DISORDERS\n\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Frederick Joseph Cade once said, \"I believe the brain, like any other organ, can get sick and it can also heal.\"\n\n\n\nHe made huge gains in healing the brain through his work with sufferers of bipolar disorder by discovering that lithium salts -- a naturally occurring chemical - could be used to treat the illness.\n\n\n\nPreviously, electro-convulsive therapy and lobotomies had been the major treatments for bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nAfter having been a prisoner of war in World War II, Dr. Cade served as the head of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne Australia. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments that led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. After trials on humans, Dr. Cade speculated that bipolar disorder was a \"lithium deficiency disease\" and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect.\n\n\n\nDr. Cade published findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1949 entitled \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement.\"\n\n\n\nHe died in 1980. Lithium is still used successfully in the treatment of mental illness to this day.\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF BACTERIA\n\n\n\nDutchman Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was known as the \"father of micro-biology.\" He drew scientific attention to the many bacteria that he discovered. His research was helped by the different types of microscopes that he developed over his lifetime. From his powerful lenses he was able to ascertain many different types of lifeforms too small for the human eye to see.\n\n\n\nIt was by observing the build-up of plaque on teeth that the Dutch scientist discovered what we now know to be bacteria.\n\n\n\nHis initial observations on bacteria make for amusing reading. On September 17, 1683, Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society about the plaque between his own teeth, \"a little white matter, which is as thick as if 'twere batter.\" He then observed two women and two old men who had never cleaned their teeth in their lives.\n\n\n\nLooking at these samples with his microscope, Leeuwenhoek wrote of \"an unbelievably great company of living animalcules, a-swimming more nimbly than any I had ever seen up to this time. The biggest sort ... bent their body into curves in going forwards ... Moreover, the other animalcules were in such enormous numbers, that all the water ... seemed to be alive.\"\n\n\n\nHe also observed algae on water surfaces and the furry coating on human and animal tongues during illness, bringing his theories to the attention of the Royal Society.\n\n\n\nMost bacteria are harmless, although some bacterial diseases are fatal: tuberculosis kills about 2 million people a year.\n\n\n\nBacteria are important in the production of cheese and yogurt, in processing wastewater and in manufacturing antibiotics.\n\n\n\nTHE CONTRACEPTIVE PILL\n\n\n\nThe oral contraceptive commonly known as \"the pill\" was invented during the 1950s in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nIt contains hormone-like substances, usually estrogen and progestin, that enter the blood stream and disrupt the production of ova and ovulation, with the aim of preventing pregnancy.\n\n\n\nIt originated after an unexpected discovery made in a jungle in Mexico in the 1930s. While Professor Russell Marker was experimenting with plant steroids, he discovered a chemical process that transformed these steroids into the female sex hormone, progesterone.\n\n\n\nResearchers in the late 1940s began to explore the possibility of an inexpensive oral contraceptive. Chemist Gregory Pincus tested a derivative from Marker's findings on 1,308 volunteers in Puerto Rico in 1958 and Searle Pharmaceuticals applied for US Food and Drug Administration approval to market the drug.\n\n\n\nThe pill came on to the market in the U.S. in 1960 and is still widely used today.

By the time she was 12, Arthur was nearly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and self-conscious about her height.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting. Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway. Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called \"Once Upon a Tune,\" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on \"Studio One,\" \"Kraft Television Theatre\" and \"The Sid Caesar Show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur drew attention in \"Threepenny Opera\" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in \"Fiddler on the Roof.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play \"Mame,\" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur left \"Maude\" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, \"Amanda's,\" in 1983 and then joined the cast of \"The Golden Girls\" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida. (Getty played Arthur's mother). The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for \"Maude.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season. White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed \"The Golden Palace,\" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts. In the early part of this decade, Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer last stage appearance was in 2006.

A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption \"evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.\"  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned \"on her own terms and own volition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe \"is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,\" Salazar said. \"She helped us with addressing a very broken system.

That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies.

They will be mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a representative of the Southern African Development Community, and Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission.\n\nBush said Friday the United States is ready to provide a \"substantial assistance package, development aid and normalization with international financial institutions\" should those talks result in a new government \"that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the president said he is authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and those displaced by the violence.

While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.\n\n\n\nFord's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.\n\n\n\nTypically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system -- which also translates into lower repair costs, and lower insurance rates, for the owner.\"\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors' Collision Repair Test Center has had also had recent success on this front, says Jim Doherty, GM's manager of the service-engineering team for aftersales body structures.\n\n\n\n\"We coordinate with the product engineers, so as soon as a new vehicle starts development, about four years before it's introduced, we engage with their team,\" says Doherty.\n\n\n\n\"Some of our people work on the structure, and some on the exterior, and we collaborate with the design engineers to work out whatever improvements might need to be made over the previous version of a component or assembly.\" AOL Autos: Best & worst auto designs\n\n\n\nAs with Ford, \"the goal is to make sure that the vehicle has the most cost-effective repair strategy,\" adds Dave Bakos, GM's director of global after-sales mechanical engineering. \"Our liaisons with people in the insurance industries are definitely useful -- they call us if they have concerns, and when we develop a new technology, we contact them to make sure they understand it.\"\n\n\n\nThe development of lighter-weight steel for auto frames also presents challenges to GM's center. \"They're very high-strength, but their repairability is more difficult when compared with the old cold-rolled steels -- so, that has forced us to come up with new welding, sectioning and attachment strategies as the vehicle is being designed and developed,\" says Doherty. AOL Autos: Take the guesswork out of buying a used car\n\n\n\nDoherty and Bakos cite a couple of examples of how the Collision Repair Test Center -- and the collaboration between design and repair engineers and insurance companies -- have been parlayed into cost savings for car owners.\n\n\n\nPrior to the current model year, the cost of repairing the frame-rail assembly on a Pontiac Solstice included $936 for the part itself, plus 13 \u00bd hours worth of labor costs to install, says Doherty.\n\n\n\nBut by working with design engineers and insurers, the Collision Repair Test Center was able to develop and create a \"service-only\" partial assembly. That means that, on the '09 Solstice, a collision technician can replace the damaged section of the front rail only, rather than the entire front rail section.\n\n\n\nThe parts for the partial assembly cost far less and require just three and a half hours of labor to install,\" says Doherty. \"Because of these changes, the total cost savings for this repair could be as high as $1,500.\"\n\n\n\nThe current Saturn Aura presented a challenge / opportunity along the same lines. For the '09 Aura, GM engineers at the Collision Repair Test Center created \"zone-specific\" replacement parts.\n\n\n\n\"Rather than replacing the entire body-side assembly as a single piece, engineers developed sectioning procedures for the front, center and rear quarter sections of the vehicle,\" explains Doherty.\n\n\n\n\"This allows the technician multiple repair options when repairing the side of a damaged vehicle. Even though the cost of parts remained similar, labor cost savings created were substantial, ranging from about $600 to as high as $1,200.\"\n\n\n\nOne current focus for these operations at Ford, GM and other carmakers relates to side-impact crashes. \"We don't want every vehicle to have to end up in the salvage yard just because a side pillar is damaged,\" says Bakos. \"So we're working on some combination of welding or welding and adhesives, or maybe mechanical fasteners, in order make those sections more repairable, so that the vehicle isn't totaled.\"\n\n\n\nNew challenges continue to present themselves, says Ford's Bonanni.\n\n\n\n\"New technologies are developing pretty rapidly,\" he says. \"And each time a new one comes along, it's our job to develop new ways of repairing the various structures, components and parts that incorporate those new technologies -- and do it in a way that maintains the vehicle's after-crash structural integrity, and keeps costs down for the vehicle owner.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "sodium dichromate.

Government records show that the camp's water was contaminated for three decades.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Marine Corps contends that two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease don't believe it.\n\n\n\nPartain said his illness has been been a \"traumatic, emotional and physical\" ordeal for his family.\n\n\n\nTwo North Carolina senators -- Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat who is not a panel member -- are pushing legislation that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover the medical costs of Marines and their families who were exposed to the contaminated water.\n\n\n\nThe provision, which has passed the Senate, would amend the Defense Appropriations Bill to prohibit the Navy from \"disposing of water-contamination claims before critical scientific studies can be completed.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Hagan, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is conducting human health and water modeling studies to determine whether the toxic water contributed to health problems at the base.\n\n\n\nSome of the water was contaminated with toxins at concentrations up to 280 times what is currently considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hagan said. The bill covers the period between 1957 and 1987.\n\n\n\n\"I think it should be our mission to give these families complete answers,\" she said. \"They can't get closure until the remaining CDC studies, which are in progress, are complete.\"\n\n\n\nSen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, added, \"I am deeply concerned about possible environmental hazards in places where we are fighting two wars.\"\n\n\n\nHe and other senators agreed that current military personnel and veterans should not have to battle red tape to get health care and benefits.\n\n\n\nRussell Powell, a medic with the 1092nd West Virginia Army National Guard, said that from April 2003 to June 2004, the unit was assigned to the Qarmat Ali water treatment plant in Basra, Iraq, to provide security for contractors with KBR, an engineering and construction company hired by the Defense Department to provide services in Iraq.\n\n\n\nWhen the platoon reached the plant, they found it in disarray and coated with orange-colored dust, he testified. Large bags of the dust had been ripped open, and frequent dust storms blew through the facility, he said.\n\n\n\nAt no time were the security guards offered protective clothing, masks or respirators, Powell said.\n\n\n\nAfter a few weeks, several soldiers began getting lesions on their hands, arms, faces and nostrils.\n\n\n\n\"As a medic, I felt very concerned for the safety and health of persons exposed. I questioned one of the KBR workers, and he told me that his supervisors told him not to worry about it, that we were allergic to sand and dust,\" according to Powell.\n\n\n\nWhen he went to a military doctor with his symptoms, the physician prescribed Motrin and Tylenol. Soon after, Powell began coughing up blood and was hospitalized. His face and lips were burned, and he could barely swallow, he said.\n\n\n\nPowell left Iraq in April 2004, still suffering symptoms, he said. Doctors didn't know what it was. This year, he said, he received a letter from the West Virginia National Guard that said he and others may have been exposed to sodium dichromate. The medic said he's aware that research is being done.\n\n\n\nSodium dichromate is a poisonous red-orange crystalline compound.\n\n\n\nAnother witness, Stacy Pennington, cried in the hearing room as she described the agony her brother suffered before he died. Army Staff Sgt. Steven Ochs was 27 when he was deployed to Iraq in 2003, she said.\n\n\n\nHe was assigned at one point to Balad Air Base in northern Iraq, where there was a large burn pit: a junk pit where plastics, food, medical waste and, Pennington said, possibly even body parts were burned. The toxic smoke wafted over the area.\n\n\n\nDr. Bill Halperin, who heads a subcommittee of the Defense Health Board, an advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense, said in a presentation last year that before three incinerators were installed, the burn pit received as much as 500,000 pounds of waste a day.\n\n\n\nAfter Ochs returned from his third Iraq tour, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, his sister said. He spent 10 months at Duke University Hospital, where doctors, she said, told him that his aggressive form of the disease was \"definitely chemically induced\" by exposures to toxic materials in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Ochs also had served."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "she wonders if part of the appeal of plus-sized ", "answer_start": "2790"}], "question": "What does the professor think about the show's inspiration?", "id": "1028", "answers": [{"text": "she wonders if part of the appeal of plus-sized ", "answer_start": "2790"}, {"text": "stems from the overweight being held up for public ridicule.

It is the first day of June and our last week before summer break. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: A Look Back\n\n\n\nAZUZ: First up, a major move for the country's largest automaker as General Motors is expected to file for bankruptcy today. This comes one month after Chrysler, another of the so-called \"Big Three\" U.S. car companies, did the very same thing. Under the terms of General Motors' bankruptcy, the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government. Thirty years ago, GM made up more than 40 percent of U.S. auto sales. Today, that number is 19 percent. The company's reported more than $90 billion in losses since 2005. As the bankruptcy process begins, Christine Romans looks back at the history of GM and the American car.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. That same year, General Motors was formed in Flint, Michigan. It wasn't until 1925 when the \"Big Three\" was complete with the formation of Chrysler Corporation.\n\n\n\nJOHN DAVIS, HOST, MOTORWEEK: When the Big Three emerged, they not only emerged as rivals that really gave Americans much better automobiles at the time, but they also cemented the American automobile as a world standard.\n\n\n\nROMANS: \"As goes General Motors, so goes the nation.\" That phrase defined America's economic power for much of the last century.\n\n\n\nPETER MORICI, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. It just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering, the country was prospering, too.\n\n\n\nROMANS: Today, there are 74,000 rank-and-file GM workers in the U.S. But in its heyday, GM was the largest industrial company in the world; a technology leader. By 1979, 600,000 people worked for GM. Those good jobs helped build America's middle class.\n\n\n\nDAVIS: It also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb, to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\nROMANS: General Moters was the company that revolutionized what we drove, how we thought about our cars, and how we paid for them. GM invented auto loans and the model year. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. And everything changed. Ford adopted flashy fins with the Ford Fairlane, as did Chrysler with the popular Desoto. Automobiles from the Big Three put their stamp on popular culture, from music to movies to television. What's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was \"Rocket 88\" by Ike Turner, about a GM product. The Pontiac GTO, considered by many to be the first true muscle car, was showcased in a song by Ronnie and the Daytonas.\n\n\n\nRONNIE AND THE DAYTONAS, \"LITTLE GTO\": Little GTO, you really....\n\n\n\nROMANS: The Corvette on Route 66.

Author William Gibson is credited with creating the word in a science fiction novel. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!\n\n\n\nCybersecurity Concerns\n\n\n\nAZUZ: It may have started as science fiction, but these days, practically all of us, including the government, spend time in cyberspace. But President Obama says we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or a country, for cyber-attacks. That's why he's planning to create a new position: cybersecurity coordinator. Jeanne Meserve explains the new job.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Hackers cut power to a skyscraper and then reprogram it to play Space Invaders in a spoof video on YouTube. But cybersecurity is not a laughing matter.\n\n\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's now clear this cyberthreat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.\n\n\n\nMESERVE: Americans use the Internet to bank and shop and talk to one another. Electricity, water, transportation all depend on it. But every day, there are attacks. The White House estimates in the past two years cybercrime has cost Americans more than $8 billion. And last year alone, hackers stole one trillion dollars worth of business secrets. Military and intelligence networks have been penetrated, and tests have shown a cyberattack can destroy critical infrastructure, like this generator. President Obama says the country is not prepared.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: From now on, our digital infrastructure, the networks and computers we depend on every day, will be treated as they should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority.\n\n\n\nMESERVE: The president will hand pick a cybersecurity coordinator to integrate policies across government, work closely with the private sector, and coordinate the federal response to attacks. Still unknown: who will get the job.\n\n\n\nJAMES LEWIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: If you get the wrong person, or you put them in an office that doesn't have very much power, you can have the best plan in the world and it still won't work.\n\n\n\nMESERVE: The plan is short on specifics, though the president says government will not dictate security standards to private industry, and will not monitor private networks or Internet traffic. Security experts say they generally like the steps the administration is taking, but warn there are many more steps to take on the long road to securing the nation's cyber-infrastructure.

If you do something wrong, you have to fix it.\n\n\n\nJERAS: Food from the garden goes to the cafeteria. Menus change depending on what's fresh. The dining hall is also trayless, saving thousands of gallons of water used to wash them. The cafeteria does more than just cook with sustainability in mind. For example, all of the oil that is used for fried foods is ultimately turned into biodiesel. That biofuel is used to fill up the school's maintenance vehicles for half the cost of gas. There is even a wind turbine on campus creating electricity. But the key is keeping the students involved.\n\n\n\nBILL DUNKEL, PRINCIPAL, THE LOVETT SCHOOL: It's really important for us to educate young people to be good citizens for the 21st century.\n\n\n\nTHOMAS MACDONALD, THE LOVETT SCHOOL: It's my earth and my water and my air, too, so I dont want anybody trashing it.\n\n\n\nJERAS: Jacqui Jeras, CNN, Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBefore We Go\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Before we go: the answer to one of life's great mysteries.

I'm just getting started.\"\n\n\n\nBefore taking questions, Obama discussed the recovery effort in New Orleans, a city struggling to get back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\n\n\"It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores,\" the president said. \"And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature, but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared and we didn't appropriately respond.\"\n\n\n\nObama said that when he took office, he pledged to make Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts and disaster response top priorities of his administration.\n\n\n\n\"So far, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress,\" he said. \"We've got a long way to go, but we've made progress.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he has sent more Cabinet members to the Gulf Coast than any other region -- \"not just to appearances, but to listen and to learn and help you move forward.\" Also, he said, his administration has helped eliminate red tape and turf disputes in order to get stalled programs moving, and freed up $1.5 billion in recovery funds.\n\n\n\nHe said his administration is tackling \"corruption and inefficiency\" that has plagued the New Orleans Housing Authority for years -- remarks that drew applause from the crowd -- and has helped move families out of emergency housing, helping homeowners rebuild and helping renters find affordable options.\n\n\n\nThe government has also invested in supporting health centers and recruiting primary care providers, nurses and other professionals to fill shortages left by the 2005 hurricane, he said.  Watch bloggers debate Obama's handling of New Orleans \u00bb\n\n\n\nBefore the meeting, Obama toured the Martin Luther King charter school -- the first charter school to reopen in New Orleans' Ninth Ward, the hardest-hit portion of the city. The president called the school \"an inspiration for this city.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, \"it's clear how far we have to go before we can call this recovery a real success,\" he said, adding that much remains to be done to repair roads, hospitals and schools and rebuild neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\"We will not forget about New Orleans,\" he said. \"We're going to keep on working.\"\n\n\n\nHe also touched on the economy and on health care reform. \"Too many Americans have waited too long for this to happen,\" he said, drawing wild cheers from the crowd. \"We are going to pass health care reform by the end of the year.\"\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenges faced by the nation, he said, \"requires diligence and perseverance and patience ... it requires a renewed spirit of cooperation among our citizens.\"\n\n\n\nHe took questions from the crowd on topics ranging from the school dropout rate to immigration.\n\n\n\nOne man asked Obama, \"Why is it four years after Katrina we're still fighting with the federal government for money to repair our devastated city? ... I expected as much from the Bush administration, but why are we still being nickeled and dimed in our recovery?\"\n\n\n\nThe president responded, \"I make no excuses for the fact that the federal government did not work effectively with state and local governments immediately in the aftermath of the storm to make sure that everybody got the help they needed right away. And we are still working through the backlog of problems that existed.\"\n\n\n\n\"My expectation is that by the time that my term is over, you guys are going to look back and you're going to say, 'This was a responsive administration on health care, on housing, on education, that actually made sure the money flowed and that things got done the way they were supposed to get done,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA fourth-grade boy asked Obama his final question: \"Why do people hate you? They're supposed to love you. And God is love.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, now, first of all, I did get elected president, so not everybody hates me now,\" Obama said. \"... If you were watching TV lately, it seems like everybody's just getting mad all the time. ... Some of it is just what's called politics, where, you know, once one party wins, then the other party kind of feels like it needs to poke you a little bit to keep you on your toes.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, he told the boy, some people have lost their jobs and are frustrated. \"When you're president of the United States, you've got to deal with all of that,\" he said. \"... I'm a pretty tough guy. Are you a tough guy?\"\n\n\n\nFour years after Katrina, evidence of the storm's devastation lingers. About 1,500 people in Louisiana are still living in temporary housing, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, although that is down from a high of more than 90,000.\n\n\n\nAnd the Army Corps of Engineers is only a third of the way through a $15 billion system to provide 100-year flood protection for the city.\n\n\n\nHowever, the agency says 76 disputed projects in Louisiana have been resolved since Obama took office, and more than $1.4 billion in aid has been sent to Louisiana, along with more than $160 million to Mississippi. And it says that more than 89,000 Louisiana households and 45,044 Mississippi households displaced by Katrina -- and by Hurricane Rita, which hit a month later -- have found longer-term housing solutions.\n\n\n\nThe emergency agency also says more than $1 billion from the stimulus program has been targeted for New Orleans.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration's efforts have been praised. In August, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, \"there is a sense of momentum and a desire to get things done.\"\n\n\n\nStill, the length and nature of Obama's visit Thursday drew some ire. The president was to spend less than four hours in New Orleans and will not visit other areas of the Gulf Coast affected by Katrina, such as the Mississippi coast.\n\n\n\n\"The people of New Orleans deserve more than a 'drive-through daiquiri' summit with the president,\" Rep.

David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote in a letter to Obama that \"if the town hall is the only major event of the visit, I truly think it will be deeply disappointing to most citizens.\"\n\n\n\nThe White House said that Obama has been to New Orleans five times since Katrina, and that since Obama took office, there have been 35 trips to the Gulf Coast by more than 20 senior administration officials.\n\n\n\n\"The president made a promise to come to New Orleans and wanted to fulfill that promise as soon as his schedule allowed,\" White House spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday ", "answer_start": "345"}], "question": "What did tthe CEO say?", "id": "678", "answers": [{"text": "the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday ", "answer_start": "345"}, {"text": "the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday ", "answer_start": "345"}, {"text": "three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France.\n", "answer_start": "453"}, {"text": "the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday ", "answer_start": "345"}, {"text": "three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France.\n", "answer_start": "453"}, {"text": "At that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating \"several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down.\"\n", "answer_start": "550"}], "validated_answers": "{\"345:429\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What was the flight path?", "id": "13f8b4119e54f14940a916568f628c2dbaNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down.\n\n\n\nAn airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year.\n\n\n\nAccording to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France.\n\n\n\nAt that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating \"several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down.\"\n\n\n\nThe jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said.

What brought Flight AF 447 down? \u00bb\n\n\n\nSome experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems \u00bb\n\n\n\nRetired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. \"Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day.\n\n\n\n\"At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it.\"\n\n\n\nWhen lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded.\n\n\n\nUnlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"fly by wire\" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces.\n\n\n\nExperts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. \"If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,\" said aeronautics expert John Hansman.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. \"It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The \"trim tab,\" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. \"Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFormer Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. \"They don't go down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340).\n\n\n\nThe aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005.

Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference they were disgusted at the video that Bergdahl's captors released.\n\n\n\n\"My personal reaction was one of disgust at the exploitation of this young soldier,\" Gates said.\n\n\n\nIn the 28-minute video, Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry.\n\n\n\n\"I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,\" he says. \"I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them.\n\n\n\n\"I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner,\" he said. However, his captors are treating him \"like a guest,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAsked by his captors if he had any message for Americans, the soldier said, \"To my fellow Americans who have loved ones over here, who know what it's like to miss them, you have the power to make our government bring them home. Please, please bring us home so we can be back where we belong and not over here.\"\n\n\n\nIt was not clear whether some or all of Bergdahl's remarks were scripted by his captors.

As you know, the situation is extremely difficult for everyone involved. We'd like to remind all of you our sole focus is seeing our beloved son Bowe safely home.\n\n\n\n\"Please continue to keep Bowe in your thoughts and prayers, and we ask for your continued acceptance of our need for privacy in this difficult situation. Thank you.\"\n\n\n\nA reporter asked Femling if the military has restricted anything he has said and he answered that it has not.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl's kidnapping, the military said. Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him.\n\n\n\n\"As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners,\" said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video. \"Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, may God protect him.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations. In the video, Bergdahl's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar, saying the move was accomplished \"very easily.\" The claim could not be independently verified. Asked the date by his captor, Bergdahl says it is July 14.\n\n\n\nTwo versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan, written in the Pashto language. They were made available to CNN by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nOne shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands with a group of kids with the message, \"One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at\" -- and lists a phone number.\n\n\n\nThe other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, \"If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted.\"\n\n\n\nThe goal of the pamphlets was to balance the effort to get Bergdahl back with how U.S. forces interact with the local population, Gates and Mullen said Monday. Mullen said the message of the second pamphlet was \"not threatening, but to express that we will do what we have to do to find this individual.\"\n\n\n\nDays after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl was captured by low-level militants and then quickly \"sold\" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani, who is believed to be deeply involved in the action.\n\n\n\nThe Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military.\n\n\n\nBergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province, got drunk and was ambushed while returning to his car.\n\n\n\nSangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims.\n\n\n\nA source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk. \"The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming [is] not true,\" the source said.\n\n\n\nIn the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol.\n\n\n\nBergdahl is not a National Guardsman, according to the Idaho National Guard statement, but the organization said it was coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide public affairs duties and other assistance to the Bergdahl family. The family has requested privacy, the statement said.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, four U.S. troops with the International Security Assistance Force were killed in eastern Afghanistan, according to a senior U.S. official there. The deaths would raise the total of U.S. military fatalities in Afghanistan to 30 in July, the highest monthly toll since the war began in October 2001.

They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\n\n\n\n\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\n\n\n\n\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.\n\n\n\n\"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill time, to be entertained, to talk with friends, not to do work.\"\n\n\n\nIn a China where economic growth comes at different speeds, So believes that the Internet has leveled out the playing field.\n\n\n\n\"The online population in China comes from very modest families,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\"Forty percent go online at Internet cafes, which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find. It costs just 30 cents per hour. The poorest kid can afford that, and these Internet cafes can be found in the most remote regions.\n\n\n\n\"So actually the Internet is flattening out this information gap, if not material gap, because even the poorest kid in China can go online and get information. And because of piracy, they can also download lots of stuff for free.\"\n\n\n\nSea turtle power\n\n\n\nAnother recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in Silicon Valley before returning to China to launch their own business.\n\n\n\nA person who has returned to China from overseas is known in Mandarin as \"hai gui,\" which sounds the same as the Mandarin words for \"sea turtle.\" Such entrepreneurial returnees include Baidu's Robin Li, Sohu's Charles Zhang and Ctrip's James Liang.\n\n\n\n\"Sea turtles bring in new ideas,\" says So. \"Like what is a search engine?\"\n\n\n\n\"Robin Li was an engineer with a patent on search mechanism, and he wanted to build a Chinese search engine. He brought in the idea, the technology and the funding. While he was still working for Infoseek in Silicon Valley, he got $1.2 million from former executives of Inktomi. Then he went back to China and recruited students and teachers from Peking University, and he built Baidu in a year.\n\n\n\n\"Finally [the sea turtle CEOs] go to the Nasdaq for IPO listing, because that is where the market really understands the Internet and can appreciate what they did.\"\n\n\n\nLikewise, China is growing from both foreign interaction and the new technological and political challenges of online culture and commerce.

On Wednesday night, inside a packed courtroom in downtown Buenos Aires, she learned their fates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have justice and these people are going to jail and I can finally walk in the streets without them,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSixteen former Argentine military officers received sentences ranging from 18 years to life in prison for their roles in human rights abuses committed during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 dictatorship. The bloody era, when the military used kidnapping, torture and murder to silence dissidents, became known as the \"Dirty War.\" The seven-year junta claimed an estimated 30,000 lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalli's parents and grandmother were among the victims.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 12, 1977, 16-month-old Marianela, her mother, Patricia, her father, Mario, and her grandmother, Violeta, were kidnapped from their home in Buenos Aires. They were taken to the Argentine Naval Mechanics School, known as ESMA, the largest and most notorious of dozens of detention centers operated by the Argentine military at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three days in captivity, the military released Galli and gave her to her father's family. Her parents and grandmother remained inside the ESMA, where they endured two months of torture before being drugged and then thrown alive from an airplane into the chilly waters of the South Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands perished in the weekly Wednesday \"death flights,\" and most of their bodies were never recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't have my parents with me. I don't have my grandmother with me. They changed my life against my will and there is nothing I can do about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarianela Galli\u00c2\u00b4s story is remarkable, but it is not unique. Five-thousand people passed through the white-washed walls of the ESMA. Most were never seen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the two-year ESMA trial on Wednesday night provided a sense of closure for victims' family members and friends, thousands of whom braved chilly spring temperatures outside the courthouse to watch a judge read the sentences on a big-screen television.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This trial took many years to happen, but thankfully our former president, Nestor Kirchner, embraced the human rights cause. That is why we are here today,\" said Tati Almeida, a member of the human rights groups Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, whose son, Alejandro, was \"disappeared\" by the military.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe silent marches staged by victims' mothers and grandmothers first brought the world's attention to the atrocities taking place in Argentina in the late 1970s. They have continued their efforts to seek justice for the victims ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a very emotional moment for me. It will take me several days to process it. Because from the first accounts I gave years ago up until now, repeatedly testifying and testifying, we now finally have the first sentences,\" said Munu Actis, a survivor of the ESMA detention center.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Judge Daniel Obligado read out the sentences, the loudest jeers were reserved for Alfredo Astiz, a former Navy captain whose boyish looks and deceitful ways earned him the nickname the \"Blonde Angel of Death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAstiz worked as a Navy spy, gaining the trust of human rights activists and then choosing which ones to target for disappearance. Astiz has been unrepentant for his actions, saying he was simply following orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not justice, this is a lynching,\" he said shortly before his sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAstiz received a life sentence for his role in the deaths of renowned Argentine writer and journalist Rodolfo Walsh, French nuns Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet, and Azucena Villaflor, one of the founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.\n\n\n\n\n\nMario Galli, Marianela Galli's father, had come up in the naval ranks together with Astiz before deciding to leave the military because of their increasingly violent tactics. It was a decision that ultimately cost him his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nA French court sentenced Astiz to life in prison in 1990 for the kidnapping and killing of two French nuns. But he remained free for more than a decade. For many years, an amnesty law in Argentina giving former military officials immunity from prosecution over human rights abuses protected him.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalli recalls seeing him one night in 1998 when she was working as a waitress at a Buenos Aires restaurant. Astiz walked in at 1 a.m. and ordered a coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I felt absolutely helpless when I saw him. I couldn't believe that this man who had helped kill my parents was allowed to be free,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ESMA trial was just one of many taking place in Argentina. Amnesty laws protecting former military officers were stripped in 2005 under the leadership of the late president Nestor Kirchner.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis wife and successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has also been a vocal proponent of putting former officers on trial. This human rights initiative has helped bolster support for Fernandez, who was re-elected to a four-year term on October 23rd with 54 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Kirchners are the ones who have made these trials happen, and I am eternally grateful to them for it,\" Jorge Morresi said after the sentencing on Wednesday. His cousin was \"disappeared\" in 1977.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sentencing of the officers took more than one hour to read. When it was finished, thousands outside the courthouse hugged, cried, danced and sang.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she embraced her aunt, Monica, who raised her following her parents' death, Marianela Galli reflected on the historic day that she had long hoped would arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a different kind of sensation.

The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.\n\n\n\nALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.\n\n\n\nALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.\n\n\n\nALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nBoth genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.\n\n\n\nLucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.\n\n\n\n\"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.\n\n\n\n\"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\n\n\nShe believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.\n\n\n\nAnd new therapies are needed.\n\n\n\nThere is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes). Bruijn says a test \"will be possible; however, currently, it is not widely accessible\" and \"it would only be used in familial ALS patients.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Israel of Germany's \"Holocaust shame,\" ", "answer_start": "57"}], "question": "what told german chancellor", "id": "300", "answers": [{"text": "Israel of Germany's \"Holocaust shame,\" ", "answer_start": "57"}, {"text": "of Germany's \"Holocaust shame,\" ", "answer_start": "64"}], "validated_answers": "{\"64:96\": 1, \"57:96\": 2}"}], "context": "JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Israel of Germany's \"Holocaust shame,\" and asserted its support for the Jewish state during an unprecedented speech to the Knesset on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nGermany and Israel are linked \"in a very special way\" by the memory of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed under Nazi Germany and its allies in World War II, she said in the first address a German chancellor has ever made to the Knesset.\n\n\n\n\"The Holocaust fills us with shame,\" she said. \"I bow my head before the survivors and I bow my head before you in tribute to the fact that you were able to survive.\"\n\n\n\nAnti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia \"must never take root again in Germany or in Europe,\" she said, and vowed to battle any flare-ups.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Knesset, Angela Merkel also spoke of Germany's unwavering support for Israel calling the Iranian president's nuclear ambitions \"a major danger\" not only to Israel, but to the world as well.

Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months.

All involved smaller aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term \"suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash. All 217 on board were killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Depression is a disease, and it's treatable just like any other disease. And there is a stigma out there that we want to remove.

The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers.\n\n\n\nThe Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant. The chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nSome of the Guardsmen already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems, according to the lawsuit.

Further, the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ.\"\n\n\n\nMark McManaway, a father and grandfather, was an Indiana National Guard sergeant at the water plant from May through September 2003, when the worst exposures are believed to have occurred. He is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\"The worst part is that the military has only just recently advised us that the stuff we were exposed to was much worse than they thought while we were out there,\" said McManaway. \"It's in our bodies, but we don't know how bad it is.

Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet. When they did, the race changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uneasiness with Kagan's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School, which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were quick to blast out blogs, columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, I was told \"more listening than talking\" was done by the administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCivil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process, and were expected to rubber stamp the choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kagan's nomination was unveiled Monday, the only prominent African-Americans in attendance were Charles Ogletree, a Harvard professor who taught both Obamas, and Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That's a stark contrast to Sotomayor's unveiling, when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Urban League and others, they are more neutral on Kagan's appointment, saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out.\n\n\n\n\n\nFolks, that's lukewarm at best.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard the previous complaints that congressional and civil rights leaders have been ignored by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, with one saying he has never attended a meeting with them (\"Even Bush sent Andy Card to meet with us,\" one leader told me). And that extends to others surrounding the president in various parts of the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These problems are valid and BIG, and we cannot let them off the hook,\" I was told by one frustrated organizational head.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet this time is different.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the Rev. Al Sharpton, but this goes beyond him. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is clearly on the outs with this administration, as seen in his banishment from the West Wing. But this contentious relationship is with civil rights, religious, economic and social justice officials. And it's getting worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne civil rights leader opined that President Obama is \"losing his emotional connection with black leadership and black voters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has huge ramifications for the president and his agenda, because Democrats are facing a major battle to hold on to the House and Senate in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released Thursday shows that voters are split over who should control Congress -- Democrats and the GOP both got 44 percent. But of those most interested in the midterm elections, Republicans garnered 56 percent to 36 percent for Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet according to a study released in April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on African-Americans, upwards of 80 percent of black voters say they are very likely to vote in November. The group surveyed 500 African-Americans in Missouri, Indiana, Arkansas and South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat helped catapult President Obama into the White House was a high black turnout, especially in the South, and he garnered 95 percent of the black vote. A drop of 10 to 15 percent by black voters for Democrats in November would be catastrophic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Kagan nomination goes forward, White House officials have told me they expect no problems from civil rights groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may be the case. But the distance is growing between this president and what many figured are his natural allies. In a year when you have energized your enemies, the last thing you need is to push away your friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

So it isn't a question of buying things, it's a question of buying nothing,\" Beemer said.\n\n\n\nBreast implants and a horse\n\n\n\nBusinesses have long recognized the benefits of bartering, and there are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country to fill their needs.\n\n\n\nThey use barter credits as currency, so a plumber in need of a filling doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other.\n\n\n\nSince all kinds of companies are members, the trades can be all over the map, said Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse.\n\n\n\n\"Really, there are no limits to it. We trade for just about anything you can think of,\" Krane said.\n\n\n\nBartering on this scale is also robust in tough economic times. Krane said his exchange has seen a 20 percent rise in barter transaction volume in the first six months of this year.\n\n\n\nA longtime client is Thomas Forrest, an orthodontist in suburban Pittsburgh who barters his services for everything from office improvements to stationery. His practice hasn't been affected by the economic downturn, Forrest said, but some of his patients seem glad to be able to visit him under the barter arrangement.\n\n\n\n\"I think if you have a business owner who has children in need of braces, I sense a gratitude that that's available,\" Forrest said.\n\n\n\nBarter exchanges must carefully document all trades, since the Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering as taxable. However, a barter exchange \"does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis,\" according to the IRS.\n\n\n\nIn New Orleans, Brown and her husband are getting ready to go to Cape Cod after finding a taker for her bartering offer on Craigslist. The couple will work five hours a day in exchange for staying in \"a beautiful three-bedroom house right in the center of it all,\" Brown said.\n\n\n\n\"We can do a lot more if we don't have to pay for room and board,\" she added."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"The Rosie Show,\" ", "answer_start": "750"}], "question": "What is the name of her show ?", "id": "88", "answers": [{"text": "\"The Rosie Show,\" ", "answer_start": "750"}, {"text": "\"The Rosie Show,\" ", "answer_start": "750"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(PEOPLE.com) -- Rosie O'Donnell was attracted to Michelle Rounds the moment she saw her in a Starbucks this summer.

Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNever happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of many investors' ideal pattern, but so are perhaps unacknowledged criteria like race, gender, cultural affinity, etc. On some level this should not be shocking, as it reflects socialization that all of us must work hard and consciously not to act on.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this racist/sexist/ageist? Well, in this context, using incendiary labels is only likely to make people more defensive. The bigger question is, is it a problem? Absolutely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not just a personal impression. In a recent study, industry analyst CB Insights found that less than 1% of all venture capital money went to digital start-ups with African-American founders in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to overcome these barriers? I have. I have developed successful, best-selling, award-winning products and I have raised tens of millions of dollars. But it is only by a sheer persistence and focus that few other people -- white, black, or otherwise -- have. I would never suggest that I am smarter than anyone else, but my Arnold-Schwarzenegger-in-\"Terminator\"-like determination has made my successes possible. Yes, I have definitely had help and support, but compared to some, not so much.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, some people get far more support than others. For example, when a top tier venture capitalist writes a $5 million check to a 19-year-old with a barely beyond napkin stage idea, no customers and a fragile technology because they \"present well,\" then clearly something else is at work beyond merit. This exact scenario may not be common, but it does happen. But it does not happen for African-American, or for that matter, Latino or female entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the bottom line is, if the level of determination that I have was required from everyone, no matter their race, on some kind of moderately equal basis, it would indeed be a level playing field -- a meritocracy. But it's not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hank Williams."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Arkansas ", "answer_start": "12"}], "question": "where was the shooting", "id": "933", "answers": [{"text": "Arkansas ", "answer_start": "12"}, {"text": "Rock military recruiting center ", "answer_start": "105"}, {"text": "at a Little ", "answer_start": "93"}], "validated_answers": "{\"12:21\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What did the convert say?", "id": "135d0f1b8d3509c4a8db6d50b11c12e85bbNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "you're the one that is trash", "id": "7572fbf16fc18a9474f8820d6f7f757501eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- An Arkansas man suspected in a shooting that killed one soldier and wounded another at a Little Rock military recruiting center was angry over the treatment of Muslims, authorities said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nPvt.

Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell.\"\n\n\n\nIn some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story \u00bb\n\n\n\nSchloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War.\n\n\n\nBut while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: \"I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her.\n\n\n\n\"She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair.\"\n\n\n\nSchloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\"Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened.\n\n\n\n\"You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time.\"\n\n\n\nLike Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland.\n\n\n\nFrank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period.\n\n\n\nEventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz.\"\n\n\n\nOf her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland.\n\n\n\nToday Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren.\n\n\n\nSchloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp.\n\n\n\nShe met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"He read a few passages but he always burst into tears. It took me 20 years. I was really unhappy, but it was Otto who came to our apartment to talk to us, and he helped me a lot. He had lost everybody.\n\n\n\n\"Her book, she [Frank] made people aware of what happened. There are many messages. She believed in the goodness of mankind.\n\n\n\n\"People always ask me, what she would have done. I guess we will never know. But I guess she would have gone into politics -- she was a fighter. It's a pity, but also -- maybe her diary would have never been published.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n", "answer_start": "2228"}], "question": "What could the discovery of water boost?", "id": "1975", "answers": [{"text": "sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n", "answer_start": "2228"}, {"text": "survival ", "answer_start": "2029"}, {"text": "sustain future exploration ", "answer_start": "2228"}], "validated_answers": "{\"2228:2279\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "trashDiscovery of water dfin lunar crater could boost efforts for future astronaut visits", "id": "202717448b1457d4cecb6926a11f9fc1085NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "trashDiscovery of water in sdlunar crater could boost efforts for future astronaut visits", "id": "39515c357d50be642f3aa5ceca19e2247c9NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "trashDiscovery of water in lunar crater could boost effortdfs for future astronaut visits", "id": "401dbd03c94f55c4c94ba904c56dfeae097NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead, unchanging satellite orbiting Earth. It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months. That's something people just hadn't thought of until just weeks and months ago. ...

The government's case relied largely on secretly videotaped conversations between the defendants and a pair of undercover FBI informants at a Frankfurt hotel in 2003. One of the informants, Mohamed Alanssi, testified that al-Moayad boasted about giving money, weapons and recruits to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\n\n\nThe charges were brought in the Eastern District of New York because al-Moayad allegedly collected terrorist funds at the al-Farooq mosque in Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nNow that the appeals court has vacated the convictions, prosecutors have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court if they feel there is a constitutional issue.

The fact that we're airing this during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it's a small part that I could do -- if I could raise awareness, if women see this and get a mammogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I started this project, it had been two years since I got a mammogram, because I was so busy. That's what happens with women. They are so busy taking care of other people, they don't put themselves first. You have to go out and do these small things. Getting a mammogram, doing your monthly self-exam, your diet, just taking care of yourself. If this film will remind women out there to do just that, that's a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not every project that you can do this -- that can possibly directly impact somebody's life.

The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.\n\n\n\nParty time in Little Havana.\n\n\n\nThe expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.\n\n\n\nStill barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.\n\n\n\nThe mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.\n\n\n\nNow that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.\n\n\n\nJust like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.\n\n\n\nThen there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.\n\n\n\nBut don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times. When it comes to partying, there's not many places that can keep up with Miami, and even fewer that can do it with as much style. In truth, there's still a touch of the old Vice about Miami, and who knows, with the 80s revival, we may not have seen the last of those white suits."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Venus Williams ", "answer_start": "115"}], "question": "which player was the favourite", "id": "899", "answers": [{"text": "Venus Williams ", "answer_start": "115"}, {"text": "Venus Williams ", "answer_start": "115"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What titles have?", "id": "61896da7b099cd8403bb7369952f04d6944NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "In what Rezai sure?", "id": "690247f060c5b5d43449fdb185c69cc7bdcNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Unseeded Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai produced one of the shocks of the year on Sunday by defeating favorite Venus Williams in straight sets to win the final of the Madrid Open.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 23-year-old Rezai -- who had only claimed WTA Tour titles at Strasbourg and Bali prior to Madrid -- continued her remarkable week with a 6-2 7-5 victory, adding Williams' scalp to her earlier surprise victories over former world number one's Junstine Henin and Jelena Jankovic.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams, who returns to No.2 in the world behind younger sister Serena on Monday, lost the opening set in just 27 minutes and then failed to take advantage of a 4-1 lead in the second set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just cannot believe this,\" world number 24 Rezai -- who must now enter calculations for the French Open -- told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Venus played very well and I've always respected her as a player and a champion.

Syed, a junior at Harvard University majoring in government, is an editorial editor at The Harvard Crimson as well as a senior editor and columnist for the Harvard-MIT journal on Islam and society, Ascent. She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling.\n\nNafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for.\n\nHe reassured Muslims in America that \"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers.\" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change.\n\nEven more important was his subsequent statement: \"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\"\n\nIn traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, \"your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims.\"\n\nAs a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world.\n\nObama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions.\n\nIn his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions.\n\nObama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world.\n\nThere is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine.\n\nObama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict.\n\nTo understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed.\n\nHowever, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise.\n\nHis interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is \"ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,\" that \"the language we use has to be a language of respect.\" After years of hearing rhetoric of \"a crusade\" and \"Islamofascism\" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world.\n\nI am sure that the Muslim world will respond with goodwill as well. Already, Obama is very well-respected there for his intelligence, eloquence and experience living in the largest Muslim country, Indonesia.\n\nMuslims abroad are just as willing as those in America to taste his message of hope and change. To win over the skeptics abroad, Obama will just have to do what he is doing in America: reach out to all sides for solutions and follow up his words with concrete action.\n\nIn the meantime, the next few weeks will see Muslims around the world taking the hand America is extending after a long hiatus.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nafees Syed."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Republicans ", "answer_start": "761"}], "question": "Which party opposed the surtax?", "id": "250", "answers": [{"text": "Republicans ", "answer_start": "761"}, {"text": "Republicans ", "answer_start": "761"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "who opposed the tax", "id": "88603b3e76ac374d52bf512c543b399c00NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats proposed Friday tax incentives for businesses hiring veterans as well as job training for all service members leaving the military.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure was unveiled as the next piece in President Obama's jobs bill and as a remedy to unemployment among veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would basically make sure that our veterans are not standing at the back of any unemployment line,\" Sen.

She was always encouraging, too, even when she was finding fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And even though she's not here anymore, I'm not afraid to say it, sometimes she was a pain in the ass,\" Rochette said laughing, probably for the first time in days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. And when she needed it most, she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the Olympic medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels good for me to talk about her,\" she said, joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left. She laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a \"What about those other two points?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz. Her mom assured her it would be all right, that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head, that this was something she had done for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for. To compete in the spotlight of the Olympics' marquee event, in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd, with the heartache of her mother's death so present would take strength most of us cannot imagine. But the people closest to her knew she had that strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer coach, Manon Perron, said there was never any doubt that Rochette would skate and never a doubt that she wouldn't be standing on the medals podium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Never ... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong,\" Perron said, just like a proud mom. \"I've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other's eyes and we know right away. It was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life, but she's not a quitter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette said she struggled more than she showed during Tuesday night's short program that captivated the skating world. When she stepped on the ice, her legs were shaking, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how I ever got through this whole program. I'm sure my mom was there with me,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette was third after the short program -- 7.14 points behind Kim Yu-Na of South Korea and 2.42 points behind Mao Asada of Japan -- who skated just before her. The free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two-thirds of a skater's total.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim made it impossible for Rochette to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6-year-old scoring system -- 150.06. The score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters' combined marks on its own. Her total of 228.56 is also a record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsada then put up a 131.72, virtually clinching silver.\n\n\n\n\n\nRochette came on the ice, looking determined, to the hockey-like cheers of the 14,000 at Pacific Coliseum. She needed a perfect skate for silver but on a triple flip, she stumbled and her chance for second place slipped away.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the program she had a bit of a shaky landing after another jump, but she stayed on her feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter she finished she blew a kiss into the air, and came to the waiting area where she, in French, covered her heart with her right hand and spoke to her mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoannie Rochette opted to stay in the games, and two days later stirred a crowd with a courageous performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Her mother is inside her heart and soul, so she'll be there for her,\" her agent Dave Baden told CNN on Wednesday, \"and [Joannie] will draw from that strength.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTherese Rochette herself wrote of the bond she had with her daughter in an e-mail interview with The Christian Science Monitor in January.

What do you think that means?\n\n\n\n\n\nFareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out.

They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they're playing games.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere. I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally. [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue, which were then attacked by the opposition, and he retracted it, which suggests that he's feeling the pressure. It suggests that there are divisions within the regime, there's some sense of vulnerability. ... It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them, but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: What do you think about the military option?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: The problems with the military option remain what they've always been, and it's a little alarming to see the way in which people are gravitating toward a military option, out of a sort of frustration that there isn't some magical solution here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe military option is certainly not a magical solution. It's a very risky strategy with many potentially large, unintended consequences. A military strike would be a pre-emptive invasion of another country by the United States. It would not have any sanction in international law.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would not be supported by the vast majority of the world, and it would only delay rather than destroy the Iranian program.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've talked to many military experts, and we do not seem to have the ability to completely destroy a program like this, partly because nuclear technology is after all not some cutting-edge technology. This is 60-year old technology, and there are lots of people in Iran who are trained scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would also strengthen the hard-line elements within the regime, would weaken the Green Movement because they would have to come out in support of the regime, and against what would be a foreign attack on Iranian soil.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would inflame the Middle East and make tensions rise everywhere, including the two places where the U.S. has a huge stake and tens of thousands of troops -- Afghanistan and Iraq -- and it would put the moderate Arabs on the defense. It would have the effect of radicalizing the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd those are pretty much the known consequences. ... Then, there's always in the business of war, the unknown consequences. What would Iran's reaction be? ... What kind of militia operations could it fund in Iraq and Afghanistan that would directly kill Americans?\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you think the administration is seriously contemplating military action?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: I don't think the administration is seriously contemplating it, but I'm struck by the degree to which many outside commentators are doing it, and the danger is ... that the administration places itself in a box where it says things which leave it no option but to keep taking a harder and harder line. I don't think it's likely, but I do worry that there is a train which is leaving the station, which might end up in a military strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you think Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been sounding the right note?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: Absolutely. Secretary Clinton has been sounding the right note and being tough, making the point that they're willing to engage with the Iranians if they are serious.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think this most recent declaration by IAEA will make it easier for us to continue building a containment strategy against Iran, getting moderate Arab countries to ally with the United States, tacitly with Israel and against Iran politically and militarily within the region, get the Europeans even more strongly on board and most crucially get the Russians and the Chinese on board for sanctions in the U.N. -- further, tighter and tougher sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN: Aside from sanctions and watchful waiting, is there anything else that should be done?\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria: I think we should be supporting the Green Movement in Iran. I don't think we need to do it in a dramatic and overt kind of way, which would probably be counterproductive. But there are ways in word and deed that the United States could make clear that we support the aspirations of those Iranians who want a more normal Iran, a more open democratic Iran, more engaged with the world. That is not inconsistent with us saying we want to negotiate with Iran. We did that with the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there was a way for us to construct a containment strategy that at the same time left room for negotiations on the one hand and also left room for us to express our hopes and support for a different Iran in the future, that would be the best long-term strategy for us. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's difficult to predict when and where things will change, but it's difficult to imagine that 25 years from now Iran will still be run by this unholy alliance of a bunch of reactionary mullahs and power-hungry military leaders."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Oklahoma ", "answer_start": "1612"}], "question": "What city has closed the airport?", "id": "144", "answers": [{"text": "Oklahoma ", "answer_start": "1612"}, {"text": "Oklahoma ", "answer_start": "1612"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "from where the storm is direct to?", "id": "1067b068c7bacd64ca99accbc9c4e5bba97NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- A major winter storm with heavy snow and ice was heading from Texas and Oklahoma to points east, with 8 to 10 inches of snow possible in some locales, the National Weather Service said Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasters warned of large accumulations of ice in places such as the north Georgia mountains, causing hazardous driving conditions.

"KIEV, Ukraine (CNN) -- A planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia, President George Bush said Tuesday, responding to concerns that the U.S. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes.\n\n\n\nPresident Bush, with President Viktor Yushchenko, praised Ukraine's democratic and military reforms.\n\n\n\n\"The missile defense system is not aimed at Russia,\" Bush said at a news conference in Kiev following talks with the Ukrainian president. \"It's viewed as an anti-Russian device. Well, it's not.\"\n\n\n\nHis comments came before he left Kiev for a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan. The summit begins Wednesday.\n\n\n\nRussia and some European countries have expressed concerns about the missile defense system. While Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to host parts of the system, others in Europe share Russian concerns that the defensive shield could be used for offensive aims.\n\n\n\nOutside the U.S. Embassy in Kiev on Monday, protesters gathered to denounce Bush's visit. They chanted, thrust signs into the air -- one reading, \"Yankee Go Home\" -- and burned an effigy of Bush in the street.  Watch the demonstration \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has tried to dissuade opposition over the plan. Washington offered to allow Russian monitors at the missile sites and to negotiate limits to the system over time. The United States also told Russia the system would not be operational until Iran test-fires a missile that could threaten Europe.\n\n\n\nMany European countries don't believe the U.S. assertion that the system is needed to guard against imminent threats from Iran or North Korea. Europe is dependent on Russia for at least 40 percent of its oil and is reluctant to upset the Kremlin.\n\n\n\nThe issue will likely be divisive at this week's three-day NATO summit, where Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to make a rare appearance. Putin normally declines invitations to attend.\n\n\n\nBush is slated to meet Sunday with Putin in the Russian resort city of Sochi on the Black Sea, according to RIA Novosti. It will be the last meeting between the two men before the outgoing Russian president steps down, the Russian news agency reported.\n\n\n\nRussia also is unhappy with NATO's eastward march. The alliance has already welcomed former Soviet republics such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Bush is pushing hard for Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO as well.\n\n\n\nBefore leaving Tuesday for Bucharest, Bush said that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia's or Ukraine's inclusion into NATO.\n\n\n\nBush said that both countries should be able to take part in NATO's Membership Action Plan, or MAP, which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance.\n\n\n\n\"I strongly believe that Ukraine and Georgia should be given MAP,\" Bush said. \"And there's no tradeoffs, period.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. president further said he was working \"as hard as I can\" to ensure the two countries are accepted into the MAP and that Russia will have no power to block their inclusion.\n\n\n\nIn remarks last month, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that NATO \"has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between NATO and the country concerned, and not subject to veto by any third party.\"\n\n\n\nRussia is not a NATO member but works with the alliance via the NATO-Russia Council. Russia's concerns also align with those of some NATO members who oppose welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into the fold.\n\n\n\nPifer said last month that NATO should strive to maintain good relations with Russia, but \"should not allow Moscow a veto, either explicit or tacit, over relations between the alliance and third countries.\"\n\n\n\nAllowing Russia a say, Pifer said, \"would encourage those in Russia who wish to reassert a Russian-led post-Soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with Europe and the West.\"\n\n\n\nBush said he phoned Putin recently to reassure him on both issues.\n\n\n\n\"NATO is an organization that's peaceful. NATO is an organization that helps democracies flourish. And democracies are good things to have on your border,\" Bush said he told Putin.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said his country should be able to start the NATO membership process.\n\n\n\n\"We are not speaking about joining NATO; we are only speaking about MAP,\" he said at the news conference. \"Why should Ukraine be deprived of that sovereign right, since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for NATO?\"\n\n\n\nBush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy, he said.\n\n\n\nResponding to a reporter's question, Bush denied that the United States might ease off on membership plans for Ukraine and Georgia if Russia acquiesces on the missile shield.\n\n\n\nBoth issues threaten to destabilize NATO, said Jane Sharp of the Center for War Studies at King's College London, but she has heard particularly sharp criticism of the missile defense plan.\n\n\n\n\"Somebody in the UK Ministry of Defense said to me, 'We are being dragged along on this missile defense thing to the American trough like pigs with rings in our noses,'\" Sharp said. \"It's a nuisance for Europeans, and I think they are irritated with the Czechs and the Poles for trying to do deals with the Americans.\" E-mail to a friend"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Three ", "answer_start": "554"}], "question": "What number of searches are planned for Monday?", "id": "1558", "answers": [{"text": "Three ", "answer_start": "554"}, {"text": "Three ", "answer_start": "554"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Search operations resumed Monday for six U.S. citizens missing since their small plane crashed Sunday evening off the north coast of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard found debris late Sunday night in the area where the single-engine Cessna 206 went down, half a nautical mile from the shoreline of the city of Quebradillas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite five searches Sunday and two others throughout the night, rescue crews were not able to find the pilot or the five passengers from the plane, the Coast Guard said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree searches are planned for Monday, said Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree male and two female passengers were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation Corp.

I love a few of them, I like a lot of them, I despise one of them. She is the Magneto to my Wolverine, the Saruman to my Frodo, the Dr. Octopus to my Spiderman. I call her The Tinkler.\n\n\n\nIt's a typical Tuesday; the office is humming along. I'm answering e-mails, writing cover lines, scheduling a dental appointment here, partial highlights there, kicking myself for not getting sushi at lunch. The sun is shining, the color printer is working -- my life is good.\n\n\n\nI mosey into the ladies' room, glance at the mirror, remind myself that fluorescent lights make everyone look as if they're in the final stages of tuberculosis, and head for a stall. And then I see it: The seat, even the floor, is covered in little yellow droplets. The Tinkler strikes again.\n\n\n\nTo date, I have been able to deduce only four things about her:\n\n\n\n1. She is female.\n\n\n\n2. She attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\n\n\n3. She works alone.\n\n\n\n4. She was raised in a barn.\n\n\n\nI've been her victim more times than I can count, and it has turned me from a happy-go-lucky columnist into a bitter, paranoid germaphobe.\n\n\n\nShe has become the bane of my existence. We live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor, where Rupert Murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news, where the White House still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the Scooter Libby case was closed, where studies indicate that worrying you're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet I am devoting an entire column to The Tinkler.\n\n\n\nAny shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family. But what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they don't feel like it and think it wouldn't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while?\n\n\n\nI've been earning a paycheck for 30 years. Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr. Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days, I've always found that the people I work with matter to me. Their moods, their opinions, their style influence my life. They've appreciated me, humiliated me, surprised me, and antagonized me. I've gotten flowers and I've gotten fired (and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to deserve either), but I've never experienced anything like The Tinkler.\n\n\n\n\"Dammit!\" I say upon encountering her latest Jackson Pollock imitation. Pat, Suzan, and Valerie each come out of their stalls to see what's wrong. I point in horror. Pat groans, Suzan moans, Val throws up her hands in disgust, and we fall into silence.\n\n\n\nThen I rally, \"At least we know it's not one of us.\" But everybody else is a suspect. \"It can't be Sudie,\" Suzan volunteers. My eyes narrow. \"What are you basing this on?\" I ask. \"I've seen her,\" she answers, \"she always heads straight for the paper seat protector.\" \"And,\" Valerie adds, \"we can cross Mamie off the list -- it happened twice while she was in Sweden.\"\n\n\n\nSixty seconds ago, the four of us were editors; now we are FBI profilers. \"She probably likes to burrow into small spaces,\" Pat conjectures. \"This never happens in the big, wheelchair-accessible stall ...\" \"It's very primitive, as if she's marking her territory. This is clearly a hostile gesture,\" Suzan declares with authority.\n\n\n\nWe're finally getting somewhere. \"So, really,\" I say, \"we just need to be on the lookout for an aggressively mean-spirited, mole-like cavewoman who is not confined to a wheelchair .. is that right?\" Val is the first to realize that we're losing our minds. \"I'm out of here,\" she says, and exits the ladies' room.\n\n\n\nLater, I complain to J.J., poor, naive little J.J .. She tells me that it can't be any of us, that the toilet is somehow to blame. I leave J.J. in her special world -- a place where troubles melt like lemon drops and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- and resume writing my column. Gina drops by and reads over my shoulder.\n\n\n\nSuddenly she has an epiphany: \"It's you!\" she announces, pointing at me like she's Javert accusing Jean Valjean of stealing silver candlesticks. \"Think about it,\" she says. \"What better way to cover your tracks than writing an outraged piece on the subject?\" I kind of like that Gina believes I am an evil genius, and I don't have the heart to tell her that I once refused to sit my daughter on the lap of a department store Santa Claus because I had no idea who else had been sitting there.\n\n\n\nAnother day, another bathroom break. \"Steer clear of the third stall,\" Yeun warns as she dries her hands and heads for a meeting. Jennifer emerges from door number four to see what exactly's going on behind door number three. She is appalled yet philosophical. \"Believe it or not, every place I've ever worked has had a Tinkler -- maybe sharing a ladies' room just sends certain people into a passive-aggressive snit. It's the dark side of office life.\"\n\n\n\nLately, my daydreams bear a striking resemblance to one of those black-and-white Sherlock Holmes movies: The entire team sits, sipping brandy in an ornate drawing room. \"I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you here today,\" I begin in an inexplicable British accent. \"Well, my friends, one of you is The Tinkler.\"\n\n\n\nThe research department averts their eyes. The art department fidgets nervously. An intern gasps. \"And,\" I go on, \"nobody is leaving this room until I reveal the person who refuses to work and play well with others.\" My assistant, Polly, looks up. \"You mean you've figured out the identity of The Tinkler?\" she asks, filled with an admiration for my powers of reasoning that she has never once expressed in real life. \"It was elementary, dear Watson. I merely -- \" but before I can unmask The Tinkler or explain why I refer to Polly as dear Watson, the lights suddenly go out ...\n\n\n\nI could go on, but I'm bored silly whenever someone feels compelled to relay every nanosecond of a dream. Suffice it to say that I usually wind up in the arms of Tyrone Power. As for The Tinkler? She's still on the lam.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of days when I find myself wishing life were closer to a gorgeous movie from the '40s -- women wore fabulous hats and pearl chokers, and I don't think they actually went to the bathroom back then. They were too busy dancing with Fred Astaire and smoking unfiltered cigarettes to schlep to an office every day.\n\n\n\nNow, some of us are running the offices, but it seems we've brought a few low-grade lunatics along for the ride -- and they're wreaking havoc in the ladies' room. Where have you gone, Edith Wharton? I'm not asking for cloth napkins and classical music. I don't need a mint on my pillow. I just want a bit of common courtesy, a modicum of civility, a touch of class, or, failing all that, a good supply of Lysol.\n\n\n\nBy Lisa Kogan from \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" April 2008\n\n\n\nSubscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

But Culhane, known as \"Al,\" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history.\n\n\n\n\n\nCulhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time \"chum\" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts.  Learn more about the current swine flu \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before.\" Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, \"Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: \"I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJust six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: \"Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from \"my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather.\" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give \"all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think,\" Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. \"At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also worried that he was \"neglecting the ladies.\" He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula (\"Her Majesty,\" he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida (\"I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home\") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named \"Hank\" who remained in Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over.\" Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, \"I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. \"Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: \"Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCulhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained \"old chums\" for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Chester Arthur Stiles, ", "answer_start": "358"}], "question": "Who faces 22 felony counts in connection with sex tape?", "id": "108", "answers": [{"text": "Chester Arthur Stiles, ", "answer_start": "358"}, {"text": "Chester Arthur Stiles ", "answer_start": "253"}, {"text": "Chester Arthur Stiles, ", "answer_start": "358"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What is the name of the young girl on the tape?", "id": "57233213cf708594e01987ff70ecd980689NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor.

As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.\n\n\n\nProsecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.\n\n\n\nPicking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"\n\n\n\n\"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.\n\n\n\n\"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision.

On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\n\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized.\n\n\n\nAfter the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture.\n\n\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance.\n\n\n\n\"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'\" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. \"'I'm the guy you're looking for.\" Stiles told police he was \"sick of running,\" Dye said.\n\n\n\nThe mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was \"relieved,\" it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault.\n\n\n\n\"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,\" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles.\n\n\n\nThe man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others.\n\n\n\nA judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years' probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis lawyers offered testimony Tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review \"did not meet acceptable mental health standards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Pablo Stewart testified that a military nurse-practitioner who examined Green some three months before the crimes \"had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYet rather than pull Green out of combat or follow up with additional care, Stewart testified, the nurse-practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent Green back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the \"Triangle of Death,\" one of the bloodiest areas of the Sunni-led insurgency.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as Lt. Col. Karen Marrs, and she was called by the defense to testify. She described Green's company as having the worst morale she'd ever seen, and she said the entire battalion was \"red,\" meaning it was \"mission incapable\" -- the troops were \"hostile, vengeful and needed increased control and command,\" without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty, not only to keep up troop numbers, but also because \"soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMarrs said procedures were followed, but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions, in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said troops often were counseled that \"having sad and angry feelings are common,\" and that \"you aren't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of Green's arrest, he told FBI agents, \"You probably think I'm a monster.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the testimony Tuesday, Green repeatedly glanced at the jury.

She owns three, and has pictures of them on Saturnfans.com, where she is one of almost 2,500 Saturn devotees who've posted photo albums of their vehicles.\n\nSaturn owners show off their Sky roadsters after a Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, on Sunday.\n\nJudy Pearson shows off a photo album of her Saturn Sky roadster the way a grandmother might show off one of her grandchildren -- pictures of vacations and happy times together.\n\nThe women are exactly the kind of customers General Motors was looking for when it introduced the Saturn brand two decades ago as \"a different kind of car company.\" The brand's slogan is now one word -- \"rethink\" -- but its fate may soon be summed up in another -- \"done.\"\n\nGeneral Motors has raised the prospect of eliminating the nameplate as it tries to restructure to regain profitability.\n\n\"I just can't stand the thought of them doing away with Saturn,\" said Dianne Pollard of Hixson, Tennessee. She created the Sky Club of Chattanooga, dedicated to the sporty two-seater.\n\nGeneral Motors hasn't officially announced the end of Saturn, but in a restructuring plan submitted to Congress, the automaker said it would concentrate resources on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.\n\nThat leaves Saturn, along with GM's Pontiac, Saab and Hummer brands, with a dim future.  See how Saturn owners are devoted to their vehicles \u00c2\u00bb\n\nPollard drove her black 2008 RedLine (that's Saturn's name for a turbo) Sky in Sunday's Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, northeast of Chattanooga. Fellow Hixson residents and Sky devotees Connie Terrell (red 2007 RedLine) and Pearson (dark blue 2007 standard edition) were there, too.\n\nAll three have owned other, more sedate Saturns than the Sky, which Edmunds.com praises for \"sharp styling, low price and everyday comfort\" and Car and Driver.com calls a \"mini-Corvette\" at around half the price.\n\nThey were joined by George and Brenda Holloway, who drove their 2007 Sky almost 100 miles from their farm in Centre, Alabama, to join in the parade.\n\n\"We thoroughly enjoy the Saturn. Our next vehicle, when we buy one, will be a Saturn,\" Brenda Holloway said.\n\n\"This is the only car I've ever owned that you can be driving down the interstate and people pull up beside you and take a picture of it,\" her husband, a retired 20-year Army veteran, said with amusement-tinged pride.\n\nBut it's not just the cars -- including the original S series sedans and coupes -- that turn people into \"Saturnistas\"; it's also the pleasant buying experience and over-the-top customer service.\n\n\"It's a family. It's the Saturn family. And you become part of that family,\" Pearson said.\n\nAll three Sky owners from Hixson had stories to tell about a sales consultant who went the extra mile or a service call that exceeded their expectations. Pearson said she has owned many makes of cars, including foreign nameplates, and Saturn's treatment of customers beats them all.\n\n\"The best experience I've ever had was with Saturn, bar none,\" she said.\n\nKoonce, of Dayton, Ohio, used to feel that way, too.\n\nBut Koonce now says GM might as well kill off the brand, because that would be preferable to the slow death she sees as inevitable.\n\nSaturn sold slightly more than 8,000 cars in November and has delivered about 175,000 this year. That's a far cry from the half a million GM had hoped to sell each year when it introduced Saturn.\n\nKoonce said she fell in love with Saturn before she was old enough to drive. She became such a familiar figure at her local Saturn dealer and so knowledgeable about its lineup that she was hired as a sales consultant.\n\nShe and her husband, Nick, met at a Saturn owners' event, their wedding was a Saturn owners' event, and they have owned six Saturns between them. They have brought numerous relatives and friends \"into the Saturn cult,\" said Nick, whose dream is to own a Saturn dealership.\n\nSaturn was conceived in the early 1980s as a separate-standing division of GM, with then-unheard-of features:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 an innovative new plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee;\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 a separate agreement with the United Auto Workers that embraced more teamwork between union and management;\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the use of plastics instead of metal for many body parts;\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 and a highly personalized consumer experience, including no-haggle buying and \"Homecomings,\" a sort of family reunion for Saturn owners at the Spring Hill campus.\n\nThe first Saturn came off the Spring Hill assembly line on July 30, 1990.\n\nUnfortunately, Kat Koonce said, GM has abandoned what made Saturn different. The cars are now made of metal, and the models all have twins in other GM divisions. Even the original Spring Hill factory has been converted to build Chevrolets instead of Saturns; the Saturn VUE is built in Mexico.\n\nSo disillusioned was Koonce that she quit her job at the Saturn dealership and went back to college.\n\n\"It was a success that became a failure,\" she said.\n\nWalter S. McManus, the head of the Automotive Analysis Division of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, says he could see it coming.\n\n\"Brand loyalty is overrated,\" McManus stated flatly. \"It is costly to do all the fuzzies, and Saturn's example is clear that it doesn't pay off for what is essentially an economy-car company. Women especially appreciated the Saturn way, but Honda sells more cars to women, despite having a less female-friendly approach.\"\n\nDon't tell that to Charlie Eickmeyer, who runs the Saturnfans Web site and has posted a \"Save Saturn\" petition for the site's 35,000 members to sign. And don't tell the Sky Club of Chattanooga.\n\n\"I think Saturn really is a different kind of car company, and that is what has brought me back to them,\" Pearson said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "3-2 victory.\n", "answer_start": "157"}], "question": "What was the score?", "id": "396", "answers": [{"text": "a 3-2 victory.\n", "answer_start": "155"}, {"text": "3-2 victory.\n", "answer_start": "157"}, {"text": "3-2 victory.\n", "answer_start": "157"}, {"text": "1-0 ", "answer_start": "1087"}, {"text": "twice, ", "answer_start": "1418"}, {"text": "3-0 ", "answer_start": "1659"}, {"text": "3-0 ", "answer_start": "907"}], "validated_answers": "{\"157:170\": 2, \"155:170\": 1}"}], "context": "(CNN)  -- English Premier League Fulham produced a superb performance in Switzerland on Wednesday to eliminate opponents Basel from the Europa League with a 3-2 victory.\n\n\n\nRoy Hodgson's men went into the away game needing victory to leapfrog their opponents and join Group E winners AS Roma in the last 32 of Europe's second-tier club competition.\n\n\n\nFulham were led by striker Bobby Zamora, who capped a recent scoring spree with two goals just before halftime.\n\n\n\nBasel hit back with a disputed penalty before Zoltan Gera put Fulham 3-1 ahead with a neat finish.\n\n\n\nBut a Marco Streller 87th minute strike for the home side set up a nervous finish for the visitors, who survived to reach the knockout stages.\n\n\n\nRoma beat CSKA Sofia in the group's other match with Alessandro Cerci scornig twice.\n\n\n\nIn Group F, French star Djibril Cisse scored a late double as Panathinaikos booked their passage with a 3-0 home win over Dinamo Bucharest.\n\n\n\nAnte Rukavina set the Greek giants on their way to the last 32 with a 55th-minute strike.\n\n\n\nTurkish side Galatasaray won the group but lost 1-0 to Austria's Sturm Graz, who scored through Daniel Beichler.\n\n\n\nIn Group D, Bundesliga Hertha Berlin beat Sporting Lisbon of Portugal 1-0 through Gojko Kacar's second half strike.\n\n\n\nIt meant Dutch side Heerenveen were eliminated despite a 5-0 home victory over FK Ventspils.\n\n\n\nSecond-half goals from Gerard Sibon, who scored twice, Mika Vayrynen, Viktor Elm and Darryl Janmaat gave Heerenveen victory, but Hertha's win spoiled their celebrations.

The rising tension raised questions about the ability of the Haitian National Police to maintain order and its tactics in doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the United States is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts, U.S. officials say the Haitian police are responsible for security on the streets, with backing from U.N. peacekeepers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,\" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. \"The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest updates | Full coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for.

Landry said the first sign of trouble was when drilling \"mud\" -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We essentially closed the wheelhouse doors. I went to the port side, and I looked out up at the derrick. That's when I see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick,\" Landry told investigators Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he radioed the rig's bridge, Landry said, its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away. Seconds later, he said, he heard \"the percussion and the slight flash of green\" of an explosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepwater Horizon sank April 22, two days after the explosion. The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nLandry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a \"kill switch\" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel. Test results from the rig's blowout preventer, a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency, and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeal inspected the rig April 1 and found no violations, he testified. But he did not inspect the preventer's emergency disconnect system, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chairman of well owner BP's American subsidiary, Lamar McKay, told a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that rig owner/operator Transocean was responsible for the rig's operation and for testing its blowout preventer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Transocean CEO Steven Newman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the well's cementing, or the casing that holds the well in place, must have failed. BP, as the well's owner, was responsible for designing the casing, while oilfield services contractor Halliburton performed the cementing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without a failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred,\" Newman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Halliburton's chief safety and environmental officer, Tim Probert, told the committee that responsibility lay with either Transocean or BP.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the cementing of the well, Halliburton simply followed BP's instructions, he said, and the blowout preventer was Transocean's responsibility."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "poems ", "answer_start": "340"}], "question": "What does Sahaab craft?", "id": "635", "answers": [{"text": "poems ", "answer_start": "340"}, {"text": "poems ", "answer_start": "340"}, {"text": "poems ", "answer_start": "340"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tuba Sahaab looks nothing like a warrior.

He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.\n\n\n\nHe then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.\n\n\n\nShopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.\n\n\n\nThere are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.\n\n\n\nShould these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\"\n\n\n\n\"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States.\n\n\n\n\"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\"\n\n\n\nSecurity expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall.\n\n\n\n\"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\"\n\n\n\nThe International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nWhile some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. Those experts suggest it's a matter of money. They say until shoppers start staying away, mall owners will not make significant changes.\n\n\n\nThere are no national standards for security guards, and according to a 2006 study by the Police Foundation, only a few states require background checks, minimum hiring standards, or training.\n\n\n\nThe study also notes that drills to test security staffs' knowledge of what to do in an emergency, when done at all, \"are seldom rigorous, seldom done with first responders, and are usually done without clear standards to measure their success.\" The report goes on to say that \"many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert.\"\n\n\n\nSince that report was written, the International Council of Shopping Centers, in conjunction with George Washington University, has developed a DVD to train mall security guards. According to Kavanaugh, about 6,000 of the nation's estimated 20,000 mall security guards have participated in the course, including 10 at Westroads Mall, where Wednesday's shootings took place.\n\n\n\nThe FBI and other federal agencies have reached out to private security firms to share information on best practices. The FBI also sends out alerts regarding possible threats to the private sector -- but warnings of possible terrorist plans are clearly of no help in anticipating an attacker like Hawkins.

But they soon got to know her as a hard-nosed, strong-willed girl, happy to debate friends, family or teachers.\n\n\n\n\"When she opened her mouth and she spoke, she really felt whatever it was,\" said Jeanette Valdespino-Torres, a childhood friend.\n\n\n\n\"And she wasn't just talking out of the top of her head -- it was something that she read, she studied, she looked, she knew. She would get into conversations at that age that I couldn't even touch.\"  Watch friends remember Sotomayor as a teenager \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn the lunchroom Sotomayor would \"hold court,\" various friends from her school years told CNN, sharing opinions on policies and social problems.\n\n\n\nShe even led discussions around her home, an apartment in the sprawling 28-building Bronxdale Housing project that was so rife with drugs and crime that police often locked it down on Saturday nights, Sotomayor said in one speech.\n\n\n\nIf she is confirmed by the full Senate Sotomayor, now 55, would be the first Latina Supreme Court justice. President Obama has spoken of her \"inspiring life's journey.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor's 1972 graduating class knew they were a generation facing \"change,\" said Jeri Faulkner, who was a freshman when Sotomayor was a senior. It was a time when the Vietnam War and social and economic strife were in the news daily.\n\n\n\n\"There was a lot of change and turmoil, and they were very involved in it -- very, very involved in social issues; very, very ready to change the world,\" Faulkner, now Cardinal Spellman's Dean of Students, said of Sotomayor's class. \"And Sonia, she was at the forefront of those discussions.\"\n\n\n\nA fixture on the debate team and in student government, Sotomayor was even a part of change inside Cardinal Spellman -- helping to write a unified constitution when male and female classes merged in 1971.\n\n\n\nOutside school, Sotomayor spent some vacations working at the United Bargains store in the Bronx, though she has admitted she was too young for a job. She also worked.with her mother at Prospect Hospital.  See photos of Sotomayor throughout her life \u00bb\n\n\n\nHard work was a fixture of the Sotomayor household. Juan Sotomayor, Sonia's father, died when she was 9, leaving her mother, Celina, to fend for Sonia and her younger brother, also named Juan.\n\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor started at the hospital as a telephone operator and later became a registered nurse. She worked long hours to earn enough to send her children to better schools like Cardinal Spellman, which now boasts of its graduate with a banner on its pale brick facade. And she used spare money to buy the neighborhood's only encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nSonia's mother was clear in what she expected from her daughter, said Valdespino-Torres. When she got home from work and stepped into the brick building, she always asked Sonia if she had done her homework, food shopping or laundry.\n\n\n\n\"Only then, Sonia would be allowed to go out,\" Valdespino-Torres said.  Watch Valdespino-Torres take a walk around the girls' old haunts \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Going out\" sometimes meant reading for grade-schooler Sonia Sotomayor. She turned to books for solace after her father died -- a loss that came a year after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She has needed daily insulin injections ever since.\n\n\n\nBut sorrow and challenges were not something she shared, Valdespino-Torres said: \"That must have been very difficult at her age to deal with, and it was something that just never really came up. She took care of it and she dealt with it.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor swapped Nancy Drew mysteries with her friends and loved talking about them, Valdespino-Torres said. Later she would become engrossed in \"Perry Mason\" and the workings of courts.  Watch Juan Sotomayor say how his sister forced him to watch 'Mason' \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn the summer, Sotomayor and Valdespino-Torres would sit on the stone steps of Blessed Sacrament -- Sotomayor's Catholic grade school.\n\n\n\nTheir parents kept watch from two-story duplex houses and through the black, steel bars of public housing apartment windows as the girls listened for hours to the latest vinyl records -- The Four Tops, The Rascals, The Beatles and Frankie Valli.\n\n\n\nSotomayor even coaxed some girlfriends to play baseball -- almost in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. (Many years later, Sotomayor would make a famous ruling that effectively ended the Major League Baseball strike.)\n\n\n\nSotomayor also spent time with her cousins, who lived in now-dilapidated apartments marred by broken windows. Entertainment might have been their grandmother calling bingo as they marked their cards with chickpeas.\n\n\n\nIt was with her cousins that Sotomayor embraced her Puerto Rican roots, she has said.\n\n\n\nThe neighborhood still boasts a heavy Latino population -- with many Puerto Rican flags in windows. Sotomayor says the sights and sounds of the neighborhood have stayed with her: salsa beats and laughter from Saturday movies featuring Mexican comedian Cantinflas.\n\n\n\nThe Bronx streets around Southern Boulevard were the center of young Sotomayor's world, but her curiosity was sparked by the No. 5 train creaking along tracks visible from her grandmother's window. At first she just made faces at riders, she has said, but then she began to wonder where the people were going.\n\n\n\nSotomayor's childhood friends say now that they knew even then that she would someday be one of those people going places.  See how Sotomayor is similar to the Supreme Court justices \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Especially because of her pure intelligence, her work ethic, her seriousness and focus,\" Procidano said. \"You kind of visualize a certain trajectory for people, and you say with Sonia, 'Well, I'm not surprised. Isn't that where she was going?'\"\n\n\n\nFaulkner, her high school classmate, added: \"I saw her as leader, for sure ... They were teenage attributes at the time, but they were there.

He is awaiting trial.\n\n\n\nPolice say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived.\n\n\n\nKerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse.\n\n\n\nKerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said.\n\n\n\nDoctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat.\n\n\n\nHer mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them, he said. Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby.\n\n\n\n\"It was a special moment where, walking, we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life,\" Reiter said.\n\n\n\nKerstin and two of her brothers, ages 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight.

Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.

The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we have time to think of Carnival,\" Lassegue said. \"Maybe when we are finished crying.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCarnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. \"But this year? I don't even remember when it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the displaced are planning days of prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're living in a city that's like a cemetery,\" said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets,\" she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way,\" she said. \"I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBaduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone,\u00ad including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvais' house collapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country,\" Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song. Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the outskirts of town, the skeletons of three floats sit like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the floats belongs to T-Vice.\n\n\n\n\n\nBandmates Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their Carnival performance \u00ad-- it's an honor to win top prize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have a good showing at Carnival, you're set for the rest of the year,\" Martino said. This year, the band had planned a soccer-themed show with a song called \"The End of the Match.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead it recently released \"Nou Pap Lage'' (We Won't Give Up\"), dedicated to the victims of the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\niReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti\n\n\n\n\n\nMartino tried to sing a few verses. \"There are so many things going through my head,\" he said.

We will rebuild Haiti. We will stand united.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't be discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I will not let go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from downloads of the song are going to the nonprofit organizations Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But he didn't know when this rare silence would end; when he would be able to write lyrics, put them to melody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're all so traumatized,\" he said.

Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.\n\nAnd aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, \"Watchmen's\" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).\n\nI'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention \"Watchmen's\" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.\n\nThese are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.\n\nTyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.\n\n\"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.\n\nBest Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?\n\nMeanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.\n\nOverall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive \"up\" weekend at the multiplex.

It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press.\n\n\n\nAt the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nConsidered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian.\n\n\n\nIn the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums.\n\n\n\nWho murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care?\n\n\n\nAnswers to these questions, or theories, keep coming.\n\n\n\n\"Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,\" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, \"The People v. Leo Frank,\" will air Monday on PBS. \"The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable.\"\n\n\n\nMixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways.\n\n\n\nThe accused\n\n\n\n\"The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,\" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank.\n\n\n\nFrank was the one who handed Mary Phagan her check when she stopped by the factory on April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day. The night watchman, Newt Lee, would find the body and call police early the next day.\n\n\n\nSmithline, of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was 16 when she first heard about the case. Her mother sat her down, told her a story about what a man in the South had been through, said it was based on her uncle and handed over a book: \"A Little Girl is Dead.\"\n\n\n\nIt turns out Smithline's mother got the news in her teens, too, when her boyfriend turned to her after seeing \"They Won't Forget,\" a 1937 Hollywood film. \"You know that's about your uncle,\" he said.\n\n\n\nShe'd grown up hearing Uncle Leo died of pneumonia, and after asking family about it, the truth was revealed, followed by the words, \"We will never talk about this again,\" Smithline said.\n\n\n\n\"I think it was a family embarrassment,\" she said. \"My grandmother [who died when Smithline was 1] was very close to her brother. It cannot be easy to tell someone your brother was lynched and why.\"\n\n\n\nThe first victim\n\n\n\nMary Phagan Kean was 13 when the story hit her. She was in a South Carolina classroom, and her name stopped short a teacher taking attendance.\n\n\n\n\"Mary Phagan, you say?\" she recalled the teacher asking, peering up from his list. He wanted to know if she was related to a girl with that name who died in 1913. Confidently, she told him she wasn't. But the boys on the playground taunted her anyway, telling her she was reincarnated from a dead girl.\n\n\n\nTraumatized, she asked her father about her name. \"He turned whiter than white,\" she remembered.\n\n\n\nMary Phagan had been her grandfather's little sister. He only wept when asked about her. When Mary Phagan Kean's family moved back to Marietta, questions about that name never stopped.\n\n\n\n\"I went on a campaign,\" said Kean, 55, who sought out every article and piece of information she could find. \"I did that for years and years and years.\"\n\n\n\nThe consensus of historians is that the Frank case was a miscarriage of justice. Crime scene evidence was destroyed, they say. A bloody hand print was not analyzed. Transcripts from the trial vanished.\n\n\n\nFrank's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor, Jim Conley, who most came to see as Phagan's killer. He'd written notes found with the body, but said they were dictated to him. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, used race in his argument, saying a black man couldn't be smart enough to come up with such stories.\n\n\n\nWitnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt. Conley's own attorney, William Smith, came to believe in Frank's innocence, scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later.\n\n\n\nConley, who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years, eventually disappeared.\n\n\n\nDorsey, the prosecutor, had political aspirations riding on this win.\n\n\n\n\"A conviction of just another black guy wasn't going to do anything for his career,\" said Sandy Berman, the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit, \"Seeking Justice: The Leo Frank Case Revisited.\"\n\n\n\nTwo years after Frank's lynching, Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia.\n\n\n\nBut the story was interpreted differently by Kean, who wrote \"The Murder of Little Mary Phagan,\" and stands by this conclusion: \"Leo Frank was guilty as sin. He was a sexual pervert.\"\n\n\n\nKean often visits her namesake's grave in Marietta. She's not the only one. She says she's struck by the teddy bears people leave there.\n\n\n\nThe governor\n\n\n\nElizabeth Slaton Wallace couldn't be prouder of her heritage. At 81, she's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton, the man who commuted Frank's death sentence to a life sentence, believing Frank's innocence would be proved and, in doing so, ruined his political career.\n\n\n\nThe Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton.\n\n\n\nFrank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where an inmate slashed his throat. He survived, but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison, with no resistance from officials, and abducted Frank in the dark of night.\n\n\n\nBy dawn, he was hanging from a tree in Marietta. Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards.\n\n\n\n\"Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that. He was railroaded. Uncle Jack knew that,\" said Wallace, who lives in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nShe can't explain why the story persists to this day. But throughout her life she's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community, especially toward her father, who was named for the late governor.\n\n\n\n\"The Jewish community could never do enough for my father,\" said Wallace, who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s. \"They could have given us the shop.\"\n\n\n\nAs grateful as they were to Slaton, Frank's lynching left Georgia's small Jewish community frightened. Many left the state; those who stayed kept a low profile. For decades, they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones.\n\n\n\nThe lynching party\n\n\n\nThe lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South. But this case, the only lynching of a Jew on American soil, was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy, historians say.\n\n\n\nWhile Georgia Jews remained quiet, so did those who were involved in Frank's killing, said Steve Oney of Los Angeles, California, who wrote the authoritative book \"And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank.\" It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly, and not just secretly, known.\n\n\n\n\"They were not liquored-up yahoos,\" said Oney, a journalist, editor and Atlanta native who spent 17 years researching his book. \"These were smart, deliberate people -- from good, prominent families.\"\n\n\n\nThey included a former governor, a former mayor, a U.S. senator's son, a judge, lawyers, a state legislator and business owners. One of the 25 or so men was Cicero Dobbs, the grandfather-in-law of Roy Barnes, a Georgia lawyer and politician who is a former governor himself and will be running again in 2010.\n\n\n\nBarnes and his wife, Marie, never knew Dobbs, who owned a taxi company in Marietta and likely provided transportation to the prison where Frank was held. Oney broke the news about the family connection to them.\n\n\n\n\"Marie's parents didn't know. It was never mentioned,\" Barnes said. \"On death beds, people confessed. It was just that powerful.\"\n\n\n\nBarnes, who is featured in the new documentary, said it's important to keep the story alive and learn from it.\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible blot on our history,\" he said. \"How we keep it from happening again is to never forget.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "more than 20 years.\"\n", "answer_start": "768"}], "question": "How many decades was his career?", "id": "399", "answers": [{"text": "more than 20 years.\"\n", "answer_start": "768"}, {"text": "20 years.\"\n", "answer_start": "778"}, {"text": "20 years.\"\n", "answer_start": "778"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "How many big projects has he been involved with?", "id": "731c9e61fa758e449b39f389342bdfae19cNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Emmy-winning Patrick McGoohan, the actor who created one of British television's most surreal thrillers, has died aged 80, according to British media reports.\n\n\n\nFans holding placards of Patrick McGoohan recreate a scene from 'The Prisoner' to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the show in 2007.\n\n\n\nThe Press Association, quoting his son-in-law Cleve Landsberg, reported he died in Los Angeles after a short illness.\n\n\n\nMcGoohan, star of the 1960s show 'The Danger Man,' is best remembered for writing and starring in 'The Prisoner' about a former spy locked away in an isolated village who tries to escape each episode.\n\n\n\nThe Internet Movie Data Base Web site says the \"mysterious final episode caused such an uproar that McGoohan was to desert England for more than 20 years.\"\n\n\n\nIn a long career in TV and movies, he was King Edward Longshanks in 'Braveheart,' and he won two Emmys for work on the 'Columbo' series starring Peter Falk.\n\n\n\nHe also did a voiceover on 'The Simpsons' cartoon of his character in 'The Prisoner.'\n\n\n\nHe was born in Astoria, New York to Irish emigrants but the family returned to Ireland shortly afterwards.

But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.\n\n\n\nIt's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nBut for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.\n\n\n\nTarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.\n\n\n\nShirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show.\n\n\n\nAnd Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles.\n\n\n\n\"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,\" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.\n\n\n\nIt's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.\n\n\n\nBut Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.\n\n\n\nVisitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.\n\n\n\n\"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.\n\n\n\nFor Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.\n\n\n\nStudying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.\n\n\n\n\"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"\n\n\n\nFrom years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.\n\n\n\n\"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.\n\n\n\nAt the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals.\n\n\n\nLife in a circus, and in most zoos, is abusive to elephants, highly intelligent and social animals who, in the wild, may roam dozens of miles in a single day, the pair said. Research has shown that elephants, like humans, can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions.  Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary. \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"Typically, when elephants are in captivity, they're under a lot of stress,\" Blais said. \"Their entire life is abnormal; it's unnatural, and that can often lead to aggression.\n\n\n\n\"Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space, and others will act out, just venting their frustrations, but it's because of what captivity offers or what captivity doesn't offer them.\"\n\n\n\nThe elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways: Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them, or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own, wanting a better life for the animals.\n\n\n\nIn their 14-year history, Blais and Buckley say, they've been able to raise enough funds to keep expanding the sanctuary and its facilities. But tough economic times are taking a toll this year, and for the first time, they are nervous they'll bring in less money than they spend.\n\n\n\nBut the mission of providing a home for the elephants they love will continue, they say.\n\n\n\n\"We feel incredibly fortunate to be doing what we do,\" Buckley said. \"It's hard work, it's long days, it's long weeks, but you're not going to hear us complain about it, because we're fortunate, and we know that.\n\n\n\n\"This is the most amazing work to do in a person's lifetime.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, ", "answer_start": "1909"}], "question": "What did the police chief say?", "id": "149", "answers": [{"text": "carrying suicide jackets ", "answer_start": "420"}, {"text": "explosives inside ", "answer_start": "449"}, {"text": "bus station, ", "answer_start": "469"}, {"text": "Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, ", "answer_start": "1909"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"1909:1972\": 2}"}], "context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have launched a massive crackdown on terror groups that they say were planning numerous suicide attacks, including in the country's largest city of Karachi.\n\n\n\nPakistan security officials show seized weapons and ammunition in Karachi on Sunday after the arrest of seven alleged militants.\n\n\n\nAt least 13 suspects were arrested Sunday and Monday, including three people carrying suicide jackets and explosives inside a bus station, a police official said.\n\n\n\nThe three were seized early Monday after police raided a bus station in Sargodha, a city located about 120 miles (190 km) south of Islamabad in Pakistan's Punjab province.\n\n\n\nThe suspects were plotting to attack two Shiite mosques, police stations, and a Norwegian telecommunications company in Punjab, according to district police officer Usman Anwar. Three other suspects linked to the plot were arrested hours later in Sargodha, he said.\n\n\n\nThose arrested early Monday included the Pakistani Taliban's chief in Punjab, according to Anwar.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban in Punjab have direct ties to Baitullah Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistan Taliban, and have been accused of sectarian murders in Punjab. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claim Mehsud is alive but ill.\n\n\n\nHakeemullah Mehsud has been selected as the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a Taliban commander said Saturday.\n\n\n\nPakistani authorities also said they thwarted planned attacks in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh province.\n\n\n\nSeven members of a banned militant group with strong ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban were arrested Sunday along with suicide vests and a large quantity of ammunition, according to the city's police superintendent Mohammed Fayyaz Khan\n\n\n\nThe group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, according to Karachi Police Chief Waseem Ahmad.\n\n\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, and was banned by then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2001. It is described as Pakistan's \"most extreme and feared militant group\" by IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information. The banned Sunni militant group, which began in the 1990s, is a \"key ally\" of the Taliban and al Qaeda, according to Jane's.\n\n\n\n\"However, many of its leaders and members have been killed or jailed in recent years and there is little evidence that it remains a coherent organization with centralized structures,\" Jane's said in an assessment released earlier this month.\n\n\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi is blamed for the attempted assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.\n\n\n\nThe group also has also been linked to the March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore.\n\n\n\nThe recent arrests in Karachi and in Punjab are part of a broader crackdown on terror groups that have extended their reach outside Pakistan's volatile North West Frontier Province and adjacent tribal regions. That is where Pakistani security forces continue to battle a strong Taliban presence.\n\n\n\nTaliban militants maintained strongholds within 100 miles of the capital, Islamabad, before Pakistani security forces pushed them back this year.\n\n\n\nA month ago, Pakistani authorities unraveled a militant plot to target government buildings in Islamabad with suicide attackers, according to Interior Minister Rehmen Malik.\n\n\n\nThree bombers were detained, and along with them suicide vests packed with complex explosives surrounded by ball bearings that would kill anyone within 50 to 100 meters.\n\n\n\n\"They had the live jackets ... they were staying in one house and they had hidden the suicide jackets not far from that (house) in the hills,\" Malik told CNN. \"Obviously they had a plan in Islamabad because Islamabad is the icon of the country.\"\n\n\n\nHe said they first planned to target parliament, then move on to other prominent government buildings in the capital city.\n\n\n\nHitting back at the government would seem to be a high priority for the newly appointed leader of the Pakistani Taliban.

This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.\n\n\n\nHis address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.\n\n\n\nThat said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.\n\n\n\nDespite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.\n\n\n\nWith Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?\n\n\n\nTurkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.\n\n\n\nReading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.\n\n\n\nNo matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.\n\n\n\nInstead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.\n\n\n\nIndeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies.\n\n\n\nThere are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.\n\n\n\nStill, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States.\n\n\n\nTo start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the \"Muslim world\" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea.\n\n\n\nTurkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices.\n\n\n\nAnything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "some dental work done, ", "answer_start": "422"}], "question": "Carter's sentencing was postponed so he could get what?", "id": "34", "answers": [{"text": "dental work ", "answer_start": "427"}, {"text": "dental work done, ", "answer_start": "427"}, {"text": "some dental work done, ", "answer_start": "422"}], "validated_answers": "{\"422:445\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Veniam eos est veritatis voluptatibus est iusto quia praesentium numquam", "id": "772ded9a32fe8344dfb850219dc8fca2c4NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Accusantium magnam consectetur non obcaecati aliquam sit quos maxime", "id": "1914903d30cfc184ec0b58ab4e29719a530NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Ut et in culpa fugiat et reprehenderit adipisicing dolorum cillum earum voluptas quo neque illum magnam Nam voluptatem", "id": "5484e1fcacd62fc4cd8a65c5206e7664449NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What have happened with Carter's sentence?", "id": "7491fff9e1a5078441eb8299ead2dea5fe3NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "New York (CNN)  -- Rapper Lil Wayne will go directly to jail after he is sentenced by a Manhattan judge Tuesday afternoon for a gun conviction, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nDwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009.

While the economic downturn has hit Tinseltown hard, Bollywood is a rising tiger -- the industry was worth $15 billion in 2008 and is projected to grow by 10 percent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\n\nWith the notable exception of this year's runaway Oscar hit \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" attempts to make crossover films for both markets have largely failed. The masala mix of genres and exaggerated acting that typifies the Bollywood formula has met limited success in the West.\n\n\n\nInstead Hollywood studios have begun bankrolling Bollywood productions solely for the Indian market. But the financial traffic is by no means one-way. In the other direction, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks recently snagged a multi-million dollar film production deal with Reliance Big Entertainment, one of Bollywood's biggest hitters.\n\n\n\nFor Kumar, the strengthening of ties between Hollywood and Bollywood is bringing many opportunities, including the chance to work alongside his childhood hero Stallone. \"Well it was great. It was an honor to work with him,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nIn addition to starring in \"Kambakkht Ishq,\" his other major role this year was as an Indian chef who learns martial arts in \"Chandni Chowk Goes to China.\" The movie was financed by Warner Brothers. (Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nThe typically flamboyant plot of \"Chandni Chowk\" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While in the Thai capital he learned martial arts, which he taught upon his return to India before becoming a male model.\n\n\n\nHe landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film \"Deeder\" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna. The couple created a buzz in India when they fell foul of the country's notoriously strict obscenity laws in March after Kumar encouraged his wife to undo the top button of his jeans at a fashion show in Mumbai. A complaint was lodged with the police and they were briefly questioned.\n\n\n\nWith more than 80 features to his name, Kumar maintains that a strong work ethic is the reason for his longevity in the movie business. \"I think it's the simplest thing. It's actually hard work and punctuality,\" the 41-year-old told CNN from the London set of his latest movie, a comedy called \"Housefull.\"\n\n\n\n\"Even if you're not a good actor, to be a producer's actor is essential. If you finish your films on time you save money for the producer,\" he noted.\n\n\n\nHis devotion to the job is coupled with a strong sense of family duty. \"I would say my success lies at the feet of my parents because that's been my biggest strength and that's what we Hindus believe,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Every morning before you go to work just touch your parents' feet and go ahead in life.

Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.\n\n\n\nMaurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nClemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.\n\n\n\n\"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"\n\n\n\nOne survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri.\n\n\n\n\"Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10\u00bd years I was governor,\" Huckabee said Tuesday. \"Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it.\n\n\n\nClemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. \"For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,\" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted.\n\n\n\nJegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that \"this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\n\nWatch what Jegley has to say\n\n\n\nIn the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. \"The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board.\"\n\n\n\nJegley told CNN he was not notified of the commutation, but he doesn't \"attribute that to something sinister. ... I just think that maybe the system fouled up and didn't get notification out to all the parties who were interested in it, my office included.\"\n\n\n\nClemmons was returned to prison after violating his parole, Huckabee said. He \"should have stayed there. For reasons only the prosecutor can explain, charges were not brought forth in a timely way and the prosecutor ended up dropping the charges, allowing him to leave prison and return to supervised parole.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that Clemmons, who had been picked up again in Pierce County, Washington, was released on bail there only days before the officers were slain.\n\n\n\n\"I can't explain why he wasn't prosecuted properly for the parole violations or why he was allowed to make bail in Washington state and not incarcerated earlier for crimes committed there,\" the former governor wrote.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Huckabee's office issued a statement saying that if Clemmons was \"found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state.\"\n\n\n\nPolice responded sharply to that statement. \"We're disappointed that Governor Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington,\" Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said. \"We're guessing that's probably a spin doctor, not him.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee wrote of Clemmons, \"I wish his file had never crossed my desk, but it did. The decision I made is one that I now wish were different, but I could only look backwards at his case, not forward. None of this is of any comfort to the families of these police officers, nor should it be. Their loss is senseless. ... Our system is not perfect, and neither are those responsible for administering it.\n\n\n\n\"The system, and those of us who are supposed to make sure it works, sometimes fail,\" Huckabee said. \"In this case, we clearly did.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "About 125,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ", "answer_start": "2841"}], "question": "who is without power", "id": "464", "answers": [{"text": "New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ", "answer_start": "2868"}, {"text": "customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ", "answer_start": "2855"}, {"text": "About 125,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ", "answer_start": "2841"}], "validated_answers": "{\"2841:2905\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What happens River in North Dakota?", "id": "547ff3b01b00cd4094b075e39ff7dcac4fNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what country is flooding", "id": "15850c5000f94e647d894e2f00678ab382dNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what About 300 workers scurry to fill 1 million sandbags to?", "id": "523d7c0acfbd11f44cab56b3e51a0bb22c6NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- The Red River at Fargo, North Dakota, reached \"major flood stage\" early Wednesday as the National Guard and a small army of volunteers filled sandbags to keep the waters at bay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is just focused on battling it once again, and they're doing it with smiles on their faces,\" said Staff Sgt.

So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.\n\n\n\nThe cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAs I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, \"Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN.\" Or \"Are you EVEN listening to me?\" Or any version of the very popular, \"I hate YOU,\" \"I hate you SO much,\" \"I hate this family,\" or just plain \"AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!\" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.\n\n\n\nSo given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.\n\n\n\nI told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sorry. You have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard it hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. (pause) OK.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.\n\n\n\nThe only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.\n\n\n\nThe HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.\n\n\n\n\"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.\n\n\n\nGiven those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\nThe hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"\n\n\n\nLet's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.\n\n\n\nMerck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAult explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, \"so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine.\" Another reason to do this early, Ault points out, is that \"our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are, say, at 22.\"\n\n\n\nAult also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and, even more important, about the realities of life, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.\n\n\n\nThese arguments aren't convincing to some parents, the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated. There are several reasons for doing this, including religious beliefs. Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active.\n\n\n\nOthers believe the drug is just too risky. CDC spokesman Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC /FDA hotline. Parents, patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine.\n\n\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act petition, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch  got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who'd had the vaccine in March-April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007. All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine.\n\n\n\nAllen cautions restraint in considering the reports. \"Most of these reactions were minor,\" he said, and the deaths \"were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine.\" The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and won't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV vaccine, he said.\n\n\n\nThe vaccine does have some known side effects. Ault has seen his share. \"I certainly hear from women who get the vaccine that it's painful, and I think some dizziness has been reported.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, fainting has been added to the list of potential side effects to watch for. Allen says doctors are now recommending that girls stay in their doctor's office for a short period after they get the injection for just that reason.\n\n\n\nThree injections are necessary to get the full benefit of the vaccine. The shots need to be administered over a six-month period and at this stage are guaranteed to work for at least five years.\n\n\n\nAll of this information leaves me confused. Frankly, I'm not really sure I have won myself over when it comes to the \"shot or no shot\" decision for my daughters. However, in the back of my mind, I hear the words a father spoke when he thought about not giving the vaccine to his still-young daughter.\n\n\n\nHe said, \"How am I going to be able to turn to my daughter when she's older and tell her, 'When you were younger, I had the chance of making sure you never got a certain type of cancer, and I decided not to do it' ?\"\n\n\n\nThat's an emotional minefield I truly don't think I'm emotionally equipped to walk through.

He did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent, the Murphy Report, which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin between 1975 and 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of Bishop Donal Murray on December 17.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resignation of Bishop Magee is not related to any of the recent statutory reports, said Patsy McGarry, religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008 the Catholic Church's own child protection watchdog, the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in Ireland, McGarry explained.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found those to be \"inadequate, and in some respects dangerous\" in Cloyne diocese.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts findings were published in December 2008, prompting calls for Magee to resign.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed \"apostolic administrator\" of Cloyne diocese.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said.

But this is not a scene on the Las Vegas strip. This action is taking place on an Indian reservation.\n\n\n\nRichard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs.\n\n\n\nBusiness at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth.\n\n\n\nNow the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country.\n\n\n\n\"Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,\" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock caf\u00e9s, hotels and casinos in the world except the caf\u00e9 in London and the casino in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nThe Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million.\n\n\n\nBowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services.\n\n\n\nKeeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education.\n\n\n\n\"I view this as historic in nature,\" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. \"We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nThe help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure.\n\n\n\n\"There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,\" he says. \"So we've always viewed our future in energy.\"\n\n\n\nThat energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land.\n\n\n\nCrow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. \"It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAs the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group.\n\n\n\n\"Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,\" says Bowers. \"And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle.\"\n\n\n\nBowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American.\n\n\n\nThe Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses.\n\n\n\nOne successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board.\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,\" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America.\n\n\n\nOne of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant, Oklahoma.\n\n\n\nWith every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all.\n\n\n\n\"Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us,\" Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier.\n\n\n\nWhen discussing the potential of the Native American Group, Ballenger remembers something her father used to show her.\n\n\n\n\"(He) showed me one stick and [said] you can break one stick easily,\" Ballenger recalls. \"When you bundle many sticks together, it is impossible to break.\"\n\n\n\nThis is her wish for the consortium -- \"That we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Kurt Cobain ", "answer_start": "192"}], "question": "who committed suicide at 27, 15 years ago", "id": "338", "answers": [{"text": "Kurt Cobain ", "answer_start": "192"}, {"text": "Fifteen ", "answer_start": "349"}, {"text": "Wednesday, ", "answer_start": "367"}, {"text": "house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered ", "answer_start": "383"}, {"text": "The Nirvana frontman, ", "answer_start": "470"}, {"text": "had ", "answer_start": "496"}, {"text": "Nirvana frontman, ", "answer_start": "474"}], "validated_answers": "{\"192:204\": 2}"}], "context": "SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The park bench facing Lake Washington is covered with flowers, poems, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and graffiti.\n\nFans leave flowers and mementos in honor of Kurt Cobain near his Seattle home.\n\n\"I miss your beautiful face and voice,\" one dedication reads.\n\n\"Thank you for inspiring me,\" says another.\n\n\"RIP Kurt.\"\n\nFifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician.\n\nThe Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills.\n\nHis death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions.\n\nCobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple.\n\nNirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands.

The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.\n\n\n\nTalking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.\n\n\n\nRather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.\n\n\n\nResearch since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred.\n\n\n\nStudents and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention.\n\n\n\nAlert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThis year, tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student-massacre plot, featuring pipe bombs and firearms, at Hillside High School in San Mateo, California. Since Columbine, school shootings have been averted in New Bedford, New York, and Covina, California, to name some others.\n\n\n\nAnd at Richmond, it was an 18-year-old bystander, overhearing others talking about the incident, who reported the crime.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the public is largely unaware of these frequently heroic acts by high school students and their teachers because they don't often get national media attention. That lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence.\n\n\n\nBut the evidence is clear. Students who know what to do when they witness school violence, or when they have a strong sense of impending violence, will become anonymous heroes. But they need to be taught what to do, which phone numbers -- including hot lines -- to call and which school officials or police department can be trusted to act on their reports. Students also need to feel confident that they can report trouble without fear of retribution from their peers or being called a snitch.\n\n\n\nIt is up to the teachers and administrators who run schools to teach their students these procedures. They need to convince students that they will listen and respond consistently to their reports of violence or possible violence.\n\n\n\nYes, local police need to develop trusting relationships with students and the overall community, or nothing will be reported. But the job of preventing violence on campus belongs primarily, if not solely, to the schools.\n\n\n\nRather than wring our hands about the so-called immorality of today's students, we should embrace them as full partners in the prevention of violence on campus. Morality is not the issue. If students are educated on what to do when the threat of violence arises and are encouraged to follow the procedures, they can be trusted to do the right thing.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Astor."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "green powerboat ", "answer_start": "202"}], "question": "What kind of craft is Earthrace?", "id": "537", "answers": [{"text": "green powerboat ", "answer_start": "202"}, {"text": "green powerboat ", "answer_start": "202"}, {"text": "powerboat ", "answer_start": "208"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It runs on 100 per cent renewable biodiesel and holds the record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe in a powerboat -- and now Earthrace is for sale.\n\n\n\nFor sale: The green powerboat Earthrace is on the market for $1.5 million.\n\n\n\nThe boat's owner, New Zealander Pete Bethune, listed Earthrace as for sale on the vessel's dedicated Web site last year, and he's now taking it on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in the hope of finding a buyer.\n\n\n\nBethune is asking $1.5 million for the trimaran, which holds the world record for the fastest time in circling the globe in a powerboat.\n\n\n\nEarthrace achieved the feat in 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes; beating the old record by over two weeks.\n\n\n\nEarthrace claims to have a net zero carbon footprint by running on renewable bio diesel.\n\n\n\nMost of the fuel is believed to come from waste animal fats.

The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the back of the photo is written, \"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\"   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for \"looking like Jews\" or \"sounding like Jews,\" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore \"Bud\" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nElmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. \"I now see where it all started,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. \"He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEfraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis,\" he said. \"The realities out there were very conducive of letting these people off the hook.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should Americans feel six decades later that the government freed the Nazi commanders responsible for atrocities against U.S. soldiers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're supposed to feel very pissed off about that, to be perfectly honest, and that feeling is very justified,\" Zuroff said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe German government has since made reparations to the soldiers held at Berga. Zuroff said now it's time for the U.S. government to do \"the right thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To apologize,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Army said it is trying to figure out the best way to honor the Berga soldiers. There are about 20 known survivors still living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The U.S. Army honors the service and sacrifice of all veterans who have fought our nation's wars. The Army is working to identify the most dignified and personal way to honor the soldiers held at the Nazi slave camp, known as Berga,\" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Willie Harris said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Army refused to answer further questions about the Berga case.  Listen in as an elderly man learns about his brother's death at the camp \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvivors have long wanted to know why the sentences of the commanders were commuted. In a letter dated June 11, 1948, to an attorney whose nephew died at Berga, the U.S. War Department said the sentences of Metz and Merz were commuted because they were \"underlings.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter goes on to say that Metz \"though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners, except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape.\" That soldier was Morton Goldstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured. They say Metz stood him against a wall, walked up to him and shot him, execution-style, through the head. As his body lay on the ground, guards riddled him with bullets, according to survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe soldiers who survived were not called to testify at the war crimes trial against Metz and Merz, instead prosecutors relied on about a dozen soldiers' statements gathered through the course of the investigation. At the trial, Metz blamed any deaths at the camp on U.S. medics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They bore the sole responsibility for the medical care,\" Metz told the court, according to the book \"Given Up for Dead,\" by Flint Whitlock, citing trial transcripts. \"I ask you: Who must bear the responsibility? The answer is obvious: The U.S. medics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThose comments don't sit well with Berga survivors. \"He was terrible, absolutely terrible. He lied,\" said Tony Acevedo, a U.S. medic who catalogued the deaths in a diary at the camp. \"Everybody hated his guts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even the German guards were scared of him.\"  Flip through Acevedo's diary from the slave camp \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nBerga survivors say they await any recognition from the Army that may come, especially after all these years.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorton Brooks, 83, said he constantly thinks about the day he was liberated. He was rail thin and had walked by political prisoners shot in the head during the forced death march. In the final hours before his rescue, his attitude was, \"Let them kill us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think all the time that I'm a survivor of this and I'm still around,\" said Brooks. \"To me, it just amazes me. I don't know how I got through.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Martin said he's still trying to process his father's role as a forgotten American war hero, armed not with a gun, but a camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The worst part is I'm just finding it out,\" he said."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "American Legion, ", "answer_start": "1502"}], "question": "Who accepts an apology?", "id": "1570", "answers": [{"text": "American Legion, ", "answer_start": "1502"}, {"text": "David Rehbein ", "answer_start": "378"}, {"text": "American Legion and to the entire veterans community,\" ", "answer_start": "508"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 2, \"508:563\": 1}"}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Friday for a department assessment that suggested returning combat veterans could be recruited by right-wing extremist groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she offered her \"sincere apologies for any offense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe met with American Legion National Commander David Rehbein at Homeland Security headquarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The secretary started the meeting with an apology to me personally, to the American Legion and to the entire veterans community,\" Rehbein told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued by the department, Napolitano said, \"We connected meaningfully about the important issues that have emerged over recent days, and I offered him my sincere apologies for any offense to our veterans caused by this report. ...

Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.\n\n\n\nAir France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.\n\n\n\nThe ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.\n\n\n\nHere, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.\n\n\n\nThe height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.\n\n\n\nFormer Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.\n\n\n\n\"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nVasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.\n\n\n\n\"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThat's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\nThe crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions:\n\n\n\nCan hurricanes form in the ITCZ?\n\n\n\nIt's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?\n\n\n\nSince the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year.

After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant.\n\n\n\nThe unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand.\n\n\n\nHe fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service.\n\n\n\nHe received battlefield treatment without anesthetic.\n\n\n\nAfter the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons.\n\n\n\nIn World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol.\n\n\n\nAt one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said.\n\n\n\nHis wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later.\n\n\n\nPatch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said.\n\n\n\n\"He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,\" a Ministry of Defence biography says.\n\n\n\n\"That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the Ministry of Defence said.\n\n\n\n\"In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,\" the Defence Ministry said. \"His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering.\"\n\n\n\nPatch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead.\n\n\n\nIn his last years, Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.\n\n\n\nOn his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor, and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer.\n\n\n\nLast year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold.\n\n\n\n\"Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride, but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent,\" the Ministry of Defence said.\n\n\n\nPatch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called \"The Last Fighting Tommy.\" The name referred to the slang term for British privates.\n\n\n\n\"While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend,\" said Jim Ross, a close friend. \"He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages: Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides, (and) settle disputes by discussion, not war.\"\n\n\n\nGen.

But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds.\n\n\n\nThey gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway.\n\n\n\nThat leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters.\n\n\n\nNo, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of \"Up\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nSuch misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, \"Up\" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials.\n\n\n\nThere's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes.\n\n\n\nAnd there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or \"Wilderness Explorer\" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around?\n\n\n\n\"Up\" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs.\n\n\n\nBut if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.\n\n\n\nRussell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it.\n\n\n\nBut instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of \"Up\"\n\n\n\nWritten by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- \"Up\" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name.\n\n\n\nScreening in 3-D where possible, \"Up\" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights.\n\n\n\nFunny and poignant and full of life, \"Up\" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about.\n\n\n\n\"Up\" is rated PG and runs 96 minutes.

Watching all of this were about 40 journalists allowed to cover the return of Myers' remains. It was the first time in almost 20 years the return of a fallen U.S. service member was able to be recorded by the media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMyers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Her decision to do so was historical and allowed the public to see a side of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the country has not yet seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only noise on the flight line was the perpetual whine of the Atlas Air 747's power generator. This was the plane that had brought Myers and another fallen soldier back to the United States. The media were not allowed to cover the other soldier's transfer and were not given his name or the circumstances of his death, because the family had not granted permission.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flight line, journalists were asked not to speak, use camera flashes or make undue movement while watching the transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith cameras rolling, an eight-member carry team wearing battle-dress uniforms and white gloves stood by the flag-draped transfer case carrying Myers, as the chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, said a prayer.  Watch the coverage of the return of the fallen service member \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team slowly moved the transfer case from the aircraft onto the loader. With a jolt, the quiet of the night was shattered as a diesel engine was started to lower the loader toward the ground and then was shut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBathed in light from the giant floodlights along the flight line, the team hoisted the transfer case and carried it to a waiting panel truck.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the transfer case was secured, the carry team saluted, the doors of the truck were slowly closed and then driven under police escort to the base mortuary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven family members watched the truck until it was out of sight, one man among them crying into a tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMyers was from Hopewell, Virginia, and died Saturday of wounds suffered in a roadside bombing, the Air Force said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was assigned to the 48th Civil Engineer Squadron, with the Royal Air Force Lakenheath, UK, and in March 2008 received the Bronze Star for valor. He was 30 years old.

In February, Gates reversed it, but with conditions.

CNN's Christiane Amanpour meets the Dalai Lama and some of his unruly flock in \"Buddha's Warriors\" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama cracked jokes and chatted when a storm knocked out power during his interview with CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nDHARAMSALA, India (CNN) -- I never knew much about Buddhism, and was not expecting much, spiritually, from covering the Dalai Lama. But what happened just goes to show how the unlikeliest events can affect you at the unlikeliest times.\n\n\n\n\n\nI flew from covering the historic visit of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in North Korea to Dharamsala, India. This is the home-in-exile of the Dalai Lama and his government, as well as thousands of Tibetan monks and supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur visit coincided with the events that commemorate each March 10, the date the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback in 1959. He managed to evade the Chinese Communist forces, disguised as a soldier and escaping at night. The somber remembrance is a little like what the Palestinians do every year. They call it al-Nakba, or \"catastrophe,\" which marks 1948 when they lost much of their land as the state of Israel was founded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, however, the March 10 anniversary took on a more ominous tone. It was the first time the growing split among Tibetan exiles burst into the open. Some of the younger generation of exiles are losing faith in the Dalai Lama's abandonment of the dream of Tibetan independence. Some want action, even if it might mean abandoning their peaceful Buddhist way.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask the Dalai Lama about this and where he thought it would lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day we visited, we attended a \"Long Life Ceremony\" in which thousands of Tibetans come from all over India and across the Himalayas from Tibet to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader, to pray for his continued health and long life and to bestow their most precious gifts upon him, including cubes of dried cheese wrapped in muslin, textiles and tapestries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt went on for more than two hours. I never thought I would sit through the whole thing, but something about the chanting, the incense and the vital connection between the Dalai Lama and his adoring flock was mesmerizing.  Watch: Amanpour investigates new breed of Buddhists \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a journalist and an observer, I was transfixed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the Dalai Lama has spent nearly 60 years in exile, people are still so faithful to him, so respectful, weeping, bowing low as they pass him sitting high above on his throne-like dais. He towers over them, and yet there is nothing removed or dictatorial about him.  See behind-the-scenes photos from Buddha's Warriors \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards we prepared for our interview. He gives many, and I wondered what we could elicit from him that would be new or noteworthy. As our cameramen were setting up, I hung around outside to quietly watch as he received the first of many visitors that day: dignitaries, ordinary tourists, prayer groups and school groups.  I've found you can tell almost everything about a person by observing the way they deal with others. He was kind, witty, warm, laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moved by some of the personal tales he heard from those visitors seeking his advice and blessing. I thought about how he must do this so many hundreds of thousands of times and yet he had time for everyone, treating each one like a VIP.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we sat down, I was immediately slightly thrown off by his style. He told us very clearly that what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to \"cultural genocide.\" And then he burst into his trademark giggles. I couldn't fully understand why, but it is apparently the Buddhist way to laugh off life's horrors, and thus survive.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went on to tell us, with great earnestness, how he approves of the Olympic Games being held in Beijing and how he is not trying to seek full independence from China, just what he calls cultural autonomy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis man, who is lionized for his quiet spirituality and for being a one-man movement of conscience, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize, calls himself a simple Buddhist monk. As we sat there, suddenly a thunderstorm broke and all our lights went out and we were plunged into darkness. Any other important interviewee would have swept out to rest while we dealt with it. Not the Dalai Lama. He sat there with us in the dark, cracking jokes and chatting, as we waited for the generator to kick in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government says the Dalai Lama is lying when he says he does not want independence from China. They call him a wolf in sheep's clothing. So why, I wondered, would he not overtly support the young generation of Tibetans who want a more proactive policy of confronting China?\n\n\n\n\n\nOver and again I asked him about the split among his ranks. He said he would not condemn them as he believed in democracy and free speech. But nor would he support their tactics or their goals. He just kept asking (rhetorically) a simple question: With what are we going to fight them? Are we 6 million Tibetans going to confront the army of 1.2 billion people? How?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government refused repeatedly to talk to us and accused us of trying to \"beatify\" the Dalai Lama. I couldn't help wondering why they won't talk to him or meet him halfway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey may be trying to wait out the 74-year-old Dalai Lama. But they must know they'll have much more trouble on their hands once he is gone and the angry younger generation takes over."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "the announcement ", "answer_start": "237"}], "question": "Who was greeted in Seoul?", "id": "7", "answers": [{"text": "the announcement ", "answer_start": "237"}, {"text": "in ", "answer_start": "292"}, {"text": "announcement ", "answer_start": "241"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea's capital when news of Kim Jong Il's death filtered through.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country's largest newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next,\" said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea: Should we fear change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food,\" he said in an interview with CNN. \"The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this.

But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat military hardware does North Korea have?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run.

Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Danish engineer Karl Kr\u00f8yer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Kr\u00f8yer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Kr\u00f8yer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, \"If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final paragraph read, \"Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA footnote revealed that \"literature\" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman)\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day\n\n\n\n\n\nLike most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as \"America's most famous boy hero.\" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead.\n\n\n\n\n\nSound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as \"the greatest modern-day philosopher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com"}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Zed ", "answer_start": "519"}], "question": "What was found at an LA construction site?", "id": "227", "answers": [{"text": "Zed ", "answer_start": "519"}, {"text": "Zed ", "answer_start": "519"}, {"text": "Zed ", "answer_start": "519"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(CNN) -- He had a rough life during the Ice Age, walking around with a couple of broken ribs and a possibly cancerous lesion on his jaw before dying at a young age.\n\nAssistant lab supervisor Trevor Valle discusses the teeth and lower jaw of Columbian mammoth fossil \"Zed.\"\n\nNow, at least 10,000 years later, visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of \"Zed,\" a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles' George C. Page Museum.\n\nZed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw.\n\n\"The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\"\n\nThe mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket.\n\nThe construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones.\n\nConstruction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said.\n\n\"It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said.\n\nJohn Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday. He described it as \"the most important discovery\" for the museum \"of the last 90 years.\"\n\nShaw said the announcement was made to \"create interest\" in the museum's discovery.\n\nAmong the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years.\n\nNot all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed.\n\n\"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\"\n\nShaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare.\n\n\"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\"\n\nThe excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession.\n\n\"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits.

In a jailhouse phone call with CNN, Russ hinted he'd eavesdropped on other inmates. He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators.\n\n\"The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and cannot be trusted,\" he said. That's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman's father, he said.\n\nOrlando police are just as skeptical of Russ. They said he provided information they already had.\n\n\"His information is not some big break in the case,\" said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department. \"We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine. She went to work at her new job, came home to her new condominium and called her parents.  Watch an update on the case \u00bb\n\nAt 10 p.m., she called her boyfriend, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Then, her family believes, she went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, she got up and showered for work. Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed, her family says, suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office. Then, she disappeared, her family said.\n\nShe did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing.\n\nPolice found Kesse's Chevy Malibu two days later. It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived. Inside the vehicle, police found some of Kesse's personal items, but her purse, wallet, two cell phones and briefcase were missing. The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found.\n\nPolice later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse.\n\nThe grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car, past a parking lot gate. Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman, because the image is partially obscured by the gate.\n\nThe person is described as 5 feet 4 inches, with a short haircut, wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes. The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared.\n\nForensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive, Sgt. Jones said. No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle.\n\nDrew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. The landscapers said they didn't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car, which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m.\n\n\"The only theory we could come up with is that she walked out her front door and was kidnapped somewhere between her front door and the parking lot where her car was. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex,\" Drew Kesse said.\n\nHe added that there weren't any surveillance cameras in the hallways or stairwells at the time his daughter was living there.\n\nSgt. Jones said investigators have developed forensic evidence from Kesse's car that could someday match with a person of interest and identify a suspect. Police have also released a photo of a green clover tattoo on Kesse's left hip.\n\nAnyone with information leading to Jennifer Kesse or the person responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the tip line at 1-800-423-TIPS.

The two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is no small investment, but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the encapsulated storage system, we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $20 million a year (that we are saving),\" said Hyundai Steel's senior executive vice president Cho Won-suk.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther steelmakers lose roughly 0.5% in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open, subjecting the material to rain and wind, according to Hyundai.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nHyundai's Dangjin plant, which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year, was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nDangjin also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials. The company says it recycles 100% of its byproducts which supplies 80% of the operation energy at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The byproduct gas contains energy and has some value. For example, it contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, so the byproduct gas can be utilized for heating up furnaces in the plant,\" vice president Cho said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure Hyundai is meeting its standards as a green steelmaker, it monitors its emission output around the clock which is not only reported to the government but is also open to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steelmaker keeps its pollution levels below half of the government's regulations, according to Hyundai's technical research center manager, Park Eung-yeul.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts tight relationship with its sister companies, Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction, is also enhancing its efforts to become more green.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does Hyundai Steel supply car parts to Hyundai Motor, the old cars at the end of their cycle come back to the steelmaker as scrap metal to be melted down and used once again. The rougher steel produced from scrap metal can then be used at construction sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these efforts, tackling CO2 emissions remains an ongoing challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the company's dedicated task force team continue the drive towards producing environmentally-friendly energy and removing the obstacles in the way of even cleaner steel production."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Gary Coleman ", "answer_start": "15"}], "question": "is Child actor best known for Diff'rent Strokes?", "id": "346", "answers": [{"text": "Coleman is ", "answer_start": "403"}, {"text": "as the wisecracking youngster Arnold Drummond on TV's \"Diff'rent Strokes\" ", "answer_start": "425"}, {"text": "Gary Coleman ", "answer_start": "15"}, {"text": "as the wisecracking youngster Arnold Drummond on TV's \"Diff'rent Strokes\" ", "answer_start": "425"}], "validated_answers": "{\"15:28\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "how many hospitals treat that condition?", "id": "7081ece3b85d6d417f9daf1fa6b48443c9NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "who cares about child actor?", "id": "538fbf1b3e9316b4ad19592f65fcdf71993NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- Actor Gary Coleman is in critical condition in a Provo, Utah, hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJanet Frank, the spokeswoman for Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, confirmed that Coleman, 42, was being treated there after being admitted on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank would not release any other information.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalls to Coleman's publicist were not immediately returned.\n\n\n\n\n\nColeman is best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold Drummond on TV's \"Diff'rent Strokes\" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former child actor was hospitalized briefly three months ago after suffering a seizure while being interviewed on a TV show in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "U.S. President-elect Barack Obama ", "answer_start": "63"}], "question": "Iran criticizes who?", "id": "0", "answers": [{"text": "President-elect Barack Obama ", "answer_start": "68"}, {"text": "U.S. President-elect Barack Obama ", "answer_start": "63"}], "validated_answers": "{\"63:97\": 2}"}], "context": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.\n\nAli Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.\n\n\"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,\" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.\n\n\"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nIn his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be \"unacceptable.\" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.\n\nLarijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran \"will not change so simply\" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.\n\nHe added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but \"you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],\" according to the news agency.\n\nObama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.\n\n\"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion.

With a population of 8.8 million people, Mexico City is one of the most densely populated areas in the country and one of the richest cities in the world. It's also a huge attraction for soccer fans and bullfighting enthusiasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom eating out any time of the night to enjoying a day in the \"Mexican Venice,\" or Xochimilco, to visiting the pyramids just outside the city, Talamantes says Mexico City is a constant surprise and delight. Here, he offers some insider tips on traveling to his hometown:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can you get the best view of the city?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're downtown, go to the top of Torre Latinoamericana. It was the tallest skyscraper in Mexico City for many years. Now, it's kind of old but keeps its charm.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're on Reforma, Mexico's most beautiful avenue, try to step into Piso 51 in Torre Mayor, the tallest skyscraper in Latin America. Beware: It is a private club, and you will be asked to join.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion?\n\n\n\n\n\nTaberna del Le\u00f3n in Plaza Loreto offers traditional Mexican cuisine in a cozy environment. It's managed by M\u00f3nica Pati\u00f1o, the famous Mexican chef.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the best place to people watch?\n\n\n\n\n\nTry barrio La Condesa -- its streets are full of bars and restaurants attracting a very interesting crowd, especially on nights and weekends. Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your favorite neighborhood? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nColonia Roma is becoming the \"Mexican Soho,\" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares. It is antique, so you can find old buildings, but it's also transforming into a more modern area.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is close to La Condesa, which is also a very cool place, full of young people.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the biggest misconception about your city?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou won't believe how many trees are in the city. And the robberies aren't that common, either.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do you go to relax?\n\n\n\n\n\nEspacio Escult\u00f3rico at the UNAM, Mexico's biggest university campus, offers a collection of sculptures by famous artists. That is a little farther south of the city. If you're not willing to travel that much, go into Bosque de Chapultepec's audiorama, where you can sit on a bench and listen to some good music.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat essential thing should visitors see or experience if they have only a few hours?\n\n\n\n\n\nGo inside Museo de Antropolog\u00eda, which showcases the very DNA of Mexico. If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a \"tourist trap\" that's actually worth seeing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called \"Mexican Venice\" because of a series of canals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere was your most memorable meal? Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town?\n\n\n\n\n\nZinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street in downtown, has great jazz music and a very cheerful crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really. Just stick to the tacos and tequila as if you were any place in Mexico. If you want something fancy, try duck enchiladas in Izote restaurant on Avenue Presidente Masaryk, Mexico's most expensive street.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a good local souvenir?\n\n\n\n\n\nRag dolls sold by the local natives in the streets."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Laura Ling ", "answer_start": "592"}], "question": "Who works for gore's current tv", "id": "540", "answers": [{"text": "Laura Ling ", "answer_start": "592"}, {"text": "Euna Lee, ", "answer_start": "607"}, {"text": "Laura Ling ", "answer_start": "592"}, {"text": "Euna Lee, ", "answer_start": "607"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "What do signs point to?", "id": "1228cf9ed5b981d4195be7bc47070f512e9NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN)  -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton landed in North Korea early Tuesday on a mission to negotiate the release of two American journalists imprisoned there since March, according to the country's state news agency and a CNN source.\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton is shown at an environmental summit in Seoul, South Korea, in May.\n\n\n\nThe North Korean news agency KCNA did not disclose the purpose of the visit in its three-line dispatch.

Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il? Will he meet Kim Jong Il?\"\n\n\n\nClinton's mission comes as the United States and its allies in the region are trying to push North Korea back into stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted a nuclear bomb test, its second, in May, and has conducted several missile tests since then. The United Nations responded by tightening and expanding sanctions on the North.\n\n\n\nThe two nations were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed at that time to halt the development of nuclear weapons, but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.\n\n\n\nClinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president.

The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai.\n\n\n\nAfghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud. Karzai had initially claimed victory, but two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. That left Karzai short of a majority, and he eventually agreed to the runoff.\n\n\n\nAbdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial.\n\n\n\nBut that request was not met, Abdullah said Sunday, and he did not believe a transparent election was possible.\n\n\n\n\"I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,\" Abdullah told reporters.\n\n\n\nU.N.

He issued a statement welcoming the decision, congratulating Karzai, and restating the U.N.'s commitment to supporting the new government.\n\n\n\n\"This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned,\" Ban said in the statement. \"Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community.\"\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah, as well as U.N. officials, including Kai Eide, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission's decision and congratulating Karzai.\n\n\n\nIn Washington, President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation.\n\n\n\n\"Although the process was messy, I'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he told Karzai \"that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance, a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption, joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security.\"\n\n\n\nObama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment, \"but as I indicated to him, the proof is not going to be in words, it's going to be in deeds.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the resolved election issue, Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan. Instead, Gibbs repeated past language that the decision would be made within weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Now begin the hard conversations about ensuring credibility and ensuring improving governance, addressing corruption\" in Afghanistan, Gibbs said.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican defeated by Obama in last year's presidential race, said Monday that Karzai's re-election should encourage Obama to fulfill Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for up to 40,000 more troops.\n\n\n\n\"The most urgent priority now is to support our Afghan partners in reversing what General McChrystal has rightly called the 'deteriorating' security situation,\" McCain said in a statement. \"This requires a properly-resourced counterinsurgency strategy, and I urge President Obama to provide our civilian and military leaders with the resources they need to succeed.\"\n\n\n\nThe cancellation of the runoff \"puts the election issue behind us,\" but Karzai has yet to achieve a true victory, according to the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\n\n\n\"Now the key issue is how the Afghan people will react to this, what kind of government will President Karzai put together, and how the international community will react,\" Khalilzad said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"We're in a new stage now in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nKhalilzad had predicted last week that Abdullah would quit the race, in an interview for CNN's \"Amanpour.\"\n\n\n\n\"First, he doesn't have much money left,\" he said in the interview, which aired Sunday. \"Second, I think that he thinks that given the situation, he's likely to lose, and maybe he'll get less votes than he did in the first round, so that would be embarrassing.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking to CNN following his withdrawal, Abdullah said his decision does not mean he has given up public life.\n\n\n\n\"I will be available to serve this country,\" he said. \"At this stage, I am in consultation with my followers, with my supporters and a movement for change will be there and I will lead that movement.

Nine others were wounded in the attack, on a guest house in Kabul. In response, the United Nations ordered nonessential personnel out of the country.\n\n\n\nInternational troop levels increased this year to provide security for the Afghan election in August.\n\n\n\nAttacks against U.S. and NATO forces have also spiked: 59 American troops died in Afghanistan in October, the highest U.S. monthly toll since the war began eight years ago.\n\n\n\nCNN's Jonathan Wald in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary ", "answer_start": "2183"}], "question": "Who makes wheelchairs?", "id": "159", "answers": [{"text": "prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary ", "answer_start": "2183"}, {"text": "Brad Blauser, ", "answer_start": "376"}, {"text": "Brad Blauser, ", "answer_start": "926"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"2183:2232\": 2}"}], "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Mothers cradle children in their arms.

In the absence of basic medical equipment, these parents do this every day.\n\n\n\nAn  Iraqi boy gives a thumbs up after receiving his wheelchair. Brad Blauser, center, created the program.\n\n\n\nKhaled is a father of three. On this day, his young daughter, Mariam, is getting fitted for her new wheelchair. Her arms and legs are painfully thin, little more than skin and bone. She's 7 years old, but looks barely half that. She and both her siblings, a sister and brother, suffer from varying degrees of polio. None of them can walk.\n\n\n\nAsked how he and his family cope, Khaled chokes up, fighting back tears.\n\n\n\n\"I am sick of life -- what can I say to you?\" he says after a long pause.\n\n\n\nOne man, Brad Blauser, has vowed to try to make life a little easier for these families by organizing the distribution of wheelchairs, donated and paid for by his charity, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids. He first came to Iraq in 2004 as a civilian contractor. Struck by the abject chaos surrounding him and seeing helpless children scooting along the ground, he pledged to find a way to help.  Watch dads, moms carry kids; tears flow when wheelchairs arrive \u00bb\n\n\n\nHis first step was to consult an Army medic to find out what hospitals really needed. \"He surprised me with his answer about pediatric wheelchairs. We've got so many children out in the city that the ones who can get around are following their friends by dragging themselves around on the ground, which is heartbreaking to see,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\"I was surprised. It took me aback.\"\n\n\n\nEnlisting the help of generous supporters and an Iraqi humanitarian group Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born in August of 2005. Thirty days later its first 31 chairs were delivered. To date more than 250 Iraqi families have received the wheelchairs.\n\n\n\nBlauser has partnered with a nonprofit group called Reach Out and Care Wheels, which sells him the chairs at a manufacturing price of about $300.\n\n\n\nThe chairs are made by prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and ultimately delivered in Iraq by the U.S. military.\n\n\n\n\"Getting these prisoners involved, it just means the world to them,\" said Andrew Babcock, the executive director of Reach Out and Care Wheels. \"Even the prisoners, I've been there and visited, and they're so excited. They come up with different design ideas and ways to make things better for the kids. They want to know where the chairs are going and what kids we're helping.\"\n\n\n\nBlauser said it's unbelievable to be there when the chairs are delivered.\n\n\n\n\"The most affecting thing about this whole wheelchairs for children is when the parents realize the gift that is being given to their children and they reach out to hug you.\" he said. \"The tears are running from their eyes and they say, 'We never thought that you could do this.' \"\n\n\n\nBlauser is helped on the Iraqi missions by the civil affairs division of the U.S. military, which helps organize the safe transport of the families to the distribution point and adjustment of the wheelchairs to fit each child.\n\n\n\nHe said it gives \"the troops something when they go home, something good to remember where they know they have contributed, they know they have done a good thing.\"\n\n\n\nArmy Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jurack agrees. \"It brings a smile to your face. It really gives a different image to the Army as a whole -- helping people out, putting a smile on local nationals' faces, little kids that need our help.\"\n\n\n\nIt's a sentiment that is echoed by Samira Al-Ali, the head of the Iraqi group that finds the children in need. On this day, she tells the soldiers she hopes that this humanitarian act will give them a different image of Iraq, not one of a gun and war, she says. Her words are simple but effective.\n\n\n\n\"I wish the world would see with their own eyes the children of Iraq and help the children of Iraq, because the children of Iraq have been deprived of everything,\" she said. \"Even a normal child has been deprived of their childhood; a disabled child and their family is dealing with so much more.\"\n\n\n\nThe children also show gratitude, even those who can scarcely move. Blauser remembers one boy's father who dressed him in a three-piece suit, with the trousers hanging off his motionless legs.\n\n\n\n\"He couldn't move his legs or his arms. But when we sat him in his chair, he gave us the thumbs up.\"\n\n\n\nIraqi parents will go to any lengths to improve the quality of their children's lives. Blauser points to one of his favorite photographs, of a father carrying his son in his arms, an endless desert road behind him. He had carried his son more than 6 miles to get a wheelchair.\n\n\n\n\"In August 2006 we had a distribution in northern Iraq,\" Blauser remembered. \"We watched him [the father] come forward, and people rushed to take the boy from his arms. And he said, 'No, I've been carrying this child all my life. I can carry him the last 100 yards to receive his wheelchair.' \" E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\nCNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report from Atlanta, Georgia."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"\n", "answer_start": "719"}], "question": "Should taxpayers be forced to pay for TV filth?", "id": "543", "answers": [{"text": "Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"\n", "answer_start": "719"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "David Bianculli notes Gov.

Chris Christie surfaced once again in the national news this week, floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever-widening, fickle field of Republican presidential contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Christie got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the \"Jersey Shore\" -- the TV show.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax break previously granted to MTV's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring Snooki, The Situation and other often inebriated free-range narcissists. In denying the show's producers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's 20% tax credit on TV shows filmed or produced in the state, Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a rain-slicked Atlantic City boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore, that's some slippery ground on which Christie is treading.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's difficult, maybe even impossible, to disagree with him on the position of being anti-\"Jersey Shore\": Anything that slows the spread of that video virus is, almost by definition, a good thing. But what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on, say, HBO's \"The Sopranos\"? Even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility, it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians have attacked TV before, but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word, or being awarded the final victory. Dan Quayle vs. \"Murphy Brown\"? The CBS sitcom won that one, handily; the single mother about whom Quayle was so upset was, after all, a fictional TV character.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, in 1992, campaigned by promising to make American families \"a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" Bart, one of the animated characters on \"The Simpsons,\" retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence, replying, \"We're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie, by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to TV productions that make New Jersey look bad, is wielding a heavy club. Where else, after all, could \"Jersey Shore\" film its reality-show escapades? Italy? (Actually, yes. They've done just that. But MTV and \"Jersey Shore\" haven't yet gone to the original Jersey shore, nestled in the English Channel and part of the United Kingdom. Maybe next year.)\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe, if CW's \"H8R\" lasts another season (which is doubtful), Christie could come on as a Snooki \"hater,\" as a nonfan did to confront the \"Jersey Shore\" standout star in this month's season premiere, and take away her show's tax credits on camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut really, the biggest media storm he could generate here, and the one that would score him even stronger political points, would be to make the tax credits, or the denial of them, qualitative as well as quantitative, and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nBear with me here: Christie could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows, and levy fines -- tackiness taxes, if you will -- for those that besmirch New Jersey in particular and the lively arts in general.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake good TV and movies, you get money back. Make bad TV and movies, you pay a surcharge.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder such a system, the better the TV show or movie, the higher the tax incentives. (This works for the other arts as well: Bruce Springsteen could do whatever he wants in Jersey, which is kind of the way things are now anyway.) Conversely, the lower a visiting TV or film production sets the crassness bar, the higher the state should set the additional taxes for filming in Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way, when something as outstanding and artistic as \"The Sopranos\" shoots on location in the Garden State, it gets a break.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Real Housewives of New Jersey,\" on the other hand, gets broken.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Janet and La Toya, ", "answer_start": "670"}], "question": "What are the names of Jackson's sisters?", "id": "675", "answers": [{"text": "Janet and La Toya, ", "answer_start": "670"}, {"text": "Janet and La Toya, ", "answer_start": "670"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would \"pull the plug\" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,\" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a \"desperate desire to get to sleep,\" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his \"This Is It\" tour.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him \"a very, very poor man,\" but it was not while the jury was present.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would \"pull the plug\" on the tour.

His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, \"sophisticated\" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'\" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use propofol at home, Lee testified.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson was not deterred, she said, even after she asked him \"but what if you don't wake up?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy District Attorney David Walgren asked her, \"And he responded, 'I will be OK, I only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while I sleep'?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes, that's exactly what I said,\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Allan Metzger, who treated Jackson off and on for two decades for \"his profound sleep disorder,\" testified Monday that Jackson called him to his home on April 18, 2009, to ask for \"intravenous sleep medicine\" to help him sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson wanted the anesthetic delivered by IV because \"he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful,\" Dr. Metzger said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetzger declined Jackson's request, instead giving him prescriptions for two oral sedatives to help him sleep."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "in Angola ", "answer_start": "90"}], "question": "Where did 1 million gather?", "id": "65", "answers": [{"text": "on Sunday, ", "answer_start": "100"}, {"text": "in Angola ", "answer_start": "90"}, {"text": "Angola ", "answer_start": "93"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"90:100\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what caused the stampede?", "id": "5457e8547f8544d4aada50bfe0f08126610NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa.\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to \"trust in God's promises.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades.\n\n\n\n\"Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth.

He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,\" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular.\n\n\n\nOne in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database.\n\n\n\nSo Benedict is making the visit, although travel \"is not his cup of tea,\" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. \"John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.\"\n\n\n\nBut Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of \"The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World.\"\n\n\n\nThe trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey.\n\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it.\n\n\n\nGibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa.\n\n\n\n\"Knowing that the pope is older, he cannot travel as much -- he does not like to travel -- makes these trips more poignant. He may never come back to Africa again.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Virgin America ", "answer_start": "1715"}], "question": "Which airline has lighting that subtly shifts throughout the day?", "id": "56", "answers": [{"text": "Virgin America ", "answer_start": "1715"}, {"text": "Virgin America ", "answer_start": "1715"}], "validated_answers": NaN}], "context": "(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize the airlines. But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future.\n\n\n\nThis test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles.\n\n\n\nDriverless pods at airports\n\n\n\nSomeday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. Currently, 18 pods are being tested at London Heathrow's Terminal 5. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust.\n\n\n\nImproved design of coach seats\n\n\n\nHong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats.\n\n\n\nIn-cabin mood lighting\n\n\n\nPoor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights.\n\n\n\nLuggage check before you get to the airport\n\n\n\nSchlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport.\n\n\n\nPaperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide.\n\n\n\nMore power --sockets -- for the people\n\n\n\nSometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane. Because while Wi-Fi is nice (even when there's a fee for it), it's even nicer to know that you won't run out of juice in the middle of a flight. Sockets obviously work with portable DVD players and cell phone chargers, too.\n\n\n\nReplacements for outmoded radar-tracking systems\n\n\n\nRadar is outdated. Locating a plane's position can take up to half a minute, a long time when planes are traveling at speeds over 500 mph. To play it safe and avoid accidents, planes fly extremely far apart from each other. They also fly routes that zigzag rather than go straight. The reason? Aircraft need to remain within signal range of radar beacons, which are irregularly spaced around the country. To shave flight times -- and improve safety -- the FAA is rolling out NextGen, a GPS-based air traffic control system that provides real-time plane locations to pilots and air traffic controllers. Using GPS technology (already in trial use by Alaska Airlines), planes will be able to fly straighter, more efficient routes while maintaining a safe distance from other aircraft. But we may have to wait until 2025 to see this technology adopted nationwide. Sigh.\n\n\n\nEasier upgrades\n\n\n\nWith most airlines, upgrading is an esoteric process that may involve loyalty program points, elite status, or just dumb luck. But when you check in at the airport for a Spirit Airlines flight, the kiosk presents a simpler formula. The screen may inform you that one of Spirit's Big Front Seats (the carrier's version of business class) is available for as little as $35 extra. The roomy seats are often dispensed on a first-come, first-served basis close to departure time. Depending on how you're feeling that day, you may very well decide that an upgrade to a more comfortable seat is money well spent.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2009.

Elspeth Cameron-Ritchie, an Army psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nConcern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs.\n\n\n\n\"Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments,\" Webb said in a written statement.

She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.\n\n\n\n\"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nLast year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nThe figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.\n\n\n\nCameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.\n\n\n\n\"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.\n\n\n\nMultiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.\n\n\n\nThe \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n\"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\"\n\n\n\nTo reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in Iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide.\n\n\n\nThat training came too late for Army Specialist Tim Bowman. The 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from Iraq.\n\n\n\n\"As my family was preparing for a 2005 Thanksgiving meal, our son Timothy was lying on the floor, slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" said his father, Mike Bowman, in testimony to a House Veterans' Affairs committee hearing in December. \"His war was now over.\"\n\n\n\nHe said veterans return home to find an \"understaffed, under-funded, under-equipped\" Veterans Affairs mental health system.\n\n\n\n\"Many just give up trying,\" he said.

Much like \"The Orchid Thief,\" it's also about obsession.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love?

The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 33 fall must-reads\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.

I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s.

People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody.

I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. Maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about loyalty and bravery. My dirty secret is that I did truly love Lassie -- but I feel I'm being unfaithful to Rin Tin Tin by confessing that.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 16 great books for dog lovers\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

I haven't quite decided. I sort of feel like the Emmys are so classy and glamorous and black tie, the host really needs to respect his job title. I think too much \"Look at me! Look at me!\" as the host of a show that big is counterproductive. So long as I make you feel confident that you're in good hands with me as the host, then it's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections. That's my role. It's not really to be a song-and-dance man.\n\n\n\nKF: Did you look back at past Emmy hosts for inspiration?\n\n\n\nNPH: Very much. Steve Allen hosted the first televised awards, which was the 7th Annual Emmy Awards, in, I think, 1955, and he was great. That was sort of my inspiration for all of this. He just had such a dry wit, a commanding voice, a great presence. You knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong, you could look to him, and he would steer you through it. It was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor, and he was sort of out there all the time. He was definitely the \"host.\" He definitely helped the show, so I like that. Johnny Carson, too, was great.\n\n\n\nKF: Hypothetically, what would you do if your name was called for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series this year?\n\n\n\nNPH: Oh my, I would graciously accept, try to keep my speech to a minimum, and then quickly set it backstage, because I have a lot more to do for the next couple hours.\n\n\n\nKF: Is the award given out early on in the show?\n\n\n\nNPH: I think it will be within the first hour. It's a nice and refreshing win-win for me, because if I do happen to win, it will be awesome-tastic, and oddly, a bit of a distraction. And if I don't win, it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show. So I'm pretty safe either way. It's a tough category, for sure.\n\n\n\nKF: So the day after the Emmys, a new season of \"How I Met Your Mother\" premieres. Last season's finale left us wondering if your character, Barney Stinson, will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky.\n\n\n\nNPH: They certainly take a stab at it. I know there will be lots of necking and making out. Lots of canoodling between Robin and I. My lips are chapped. They have strong physical chemistry, apparently.\n\n\n\nKF: \"How I Met Your Mother\" puts a lot of stake in fate. Are you a believer in fate?\n\n\n\nNPH: I don't know what to make of fate. I certainly don't think you can predetermine things. It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen, it rarely does. But if you allow for good things to happen, they seem to. I think a lot of that is more perception, you know? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another, and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it wasn't worse. That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that. I think if you try to angle your life in those ways, then fate, destiny, karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life\n\n\n\nKF: I'm curious, how did your father meet your mother?\n\n\n\nNPH: They were college, fraternity and sorority sweethearts. This was in Albuquerque. She was in Alpha Chi Omega. And he was in, something Pi? They did the whole, you know, he gave her his pin. She was pinned, and they were a couple. Then, they were married, and they've only been with each other. I'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents. ... We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we were never made to feel poor. They had amazing senses of humor, senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids. So I lucked out.\n\n\n\nKF: Did your parents help you survive child stardom?\n\n\n\nNPH: They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous. They're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame. Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother's well-being during all of our crazy times, whether they be intimate or very public. They're remarkable people.

Fast forward 400-plus years, and we don't really have an official bard, per se -- at least not in corporeal form.\n\n\n\n\n\nNope, if you want to put your finger on the entity that's currently shaping and torquing our lexicon like a game of drunken Twister, you're already there: Look down at your keyboard, and then at the screen and down at your keyboard again. Yup. Our bard would be the internet, breeding ground of such gems as \"BRB,\" \"tweet,\" and, sadly, \"OMG!!!!!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome may call the advent of internet-speak the demise of the English language, and to them we would say, \"STFU.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, \"unfriend\" was deemed the word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary. So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, Shakespeare coined the word \"puke,\" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene:\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (\"This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (\"Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin').\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how \"Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore\" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'...\n\n\n\n\n\n@\n\n\n\n\n\nMoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the \"@\" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as \"@Tom\" or \"@T-Bone\" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant. You already said their name, so why do you need a directive?\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more egregious is rattling off your Twitter handle in any person-to-person situation (Exception: At tech and social media events this rule is a little less hard and fast, given that your Twitter handle is akin to your phone number).\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does it reek of self-promotion, it's just weird. And take it from us, tech and social-media experts' behavioral standards should not exactly be your yardstick of appropriateness.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOL\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, did you know that before \"LOL\" came to mean \"laughing out loud,\" it was code for \"little old lady\" in the medical world? Well, unless you're a doc alerting your compatriots to the arrival of a particularly ornery blue-haired broad, never should you stir your vocal cords to utter the phrase \"LOL.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy? Because you're not actually laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day that LOL becomes common parlance, my friends, will be the day that this whole internet Bard-penned comedy will become a complete and utter tragedy."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Bryant Purvis, ", "answer_start": "257"}], "question": "Fight involving Jena 6 teen does not appear to be racially motivated, official says", "id": "1082", "answers": [{"text": "Bryant Purvis, ", "answer_start": "257"}], "validated_answers": "{\"none\": 1, \"bad_question\": 2}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Bryant Purvis, 19, is facing misdemeanor assault charges, police say", "id": "133469a2ec6c6d749ad9a54c5fa8f822bf8NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN) -- A member of the group dubbed the \"Jena 6\" is facing misdemeanor assault charges after a fight at his Texas high school Wednesday, police said Thursday.\n\n\n\nBryant Purvis was arrested after a fight Wednesday at his Texas high school, police said.\n\n\n\nBryant Purvis, 19, was arrested after the incident at Hebron High School in Carrollton, Texas.

The doctors say they haven't seen any such signs.\n\n\n\nThe transplant recipient has to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue.\n\n\n\nIn the past three years, facial transplants have been completed in France and China, but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions.

Both received major facial disfigurements.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. Watch a 2006 report about China's first face transplant\n\n\n\nGuo Shuzhong, the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case, confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes. Li last visited the hospital in summer 2007, and he stayed in his hometown in Yunnan province.\n\n\n\nThe doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found. Watch an ITN report about the Li's case\n\n\n\nThe facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks. Those procedures have been \"under an ethical cloud,\" said David Young, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\n\nThe current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.\n\n\n\nCriticism of facial transplants\n\n\n\nCritics such as Peter A. Clark, director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death.\n\n\n\n\"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant,\" Clark said. \"Even with a kidney or liver [transplant], you have to be put on immunosuppressants with serious side effects.\"\n\n\n\nBioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical Ethics Department, said Wednesday on CNN's \"American Morning\" that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant, which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it, but was gradually convinced.\n\n\n\nPeople with major facial disfigurements \"don't come out and basically stay at home and have a huge suicide rate,\" Caplan said. \"They're really up against it.\"\n\n\n\nAt the news conference Wednesday, Kodish said the transplant had \"abundant moral justification\": the face as a personal embodiment as self.\n\n\n\nHe added that people with disfigurements are often isolated and suffer tremendously and that this case was \"not cosmetic surgery in any sense.\"\n\n\n\nPatient's reaction\n\n\n\nDoctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.\n\n\n\n\"At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face,\" Siemionow said. \"She was happy when she could go over her face\" and could feel that \"she has a nose, she has jaws and has a full face.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the surgery, the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine.\n\n\n\nAs she was slowly awakening, medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable.\n\n\n\n\"She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable,\" said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery. \"She has been speaking to us very slightly. Most of communication has been through writing.\"\n\n\n\nSiemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.\n\n\n\nCNN's Miriam Falco and Judy Kwon contributed to this report."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Dubai ", "answer_start": "122"}], "question": "What is the Palm Jumeirah?", "id": "147", "answers": [{"text": "Dubai ", "answer_start": "122"}, {"text": "A huge man-made island ", "answer_start": "37"}, {"text": "A huge man-made island ", "answer_start": "37"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Who is Robert De Niro?", "id": "4303f99f1c1968545b4b379235c05f9d5c5NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A huge man-made island shaped like a date palm tree opened Thursday off the coast of Dubai with a celebrity-studded gala and a three-day party.\n\n\n\nThe island officially opens with a spectacular fireworks display.\n\n\n\nThe Palm Jumeirah increased Dubai's shoreline by 100 percent after work started on it in 2001.\n\n\n\nIt features resort hotels, homes, luxury shopping and entertainment.\n\n\n\nThough the entire island officially opened Thursday, parts of it already opened weeks ago -- including the Atlantis, The Palm, a sister to the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas.\n\n\n\nThe Atlantis played host to the opening celebration Thursday night.\n\n\n\nStars including Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Robert De Niro, Janet Jackson and the Duchess of York were in attendance.\n\n\n\nPop star Kylie Minogue performed at the party.\n\n\n\nBollywood star Priyanka Chopra started what was billed as the world's largest-ever fireworks display, with more than 100,000 pyrotechnic devices.\n\n\n\nWhen work on the island began, a team of Dutch engineers were employed to create the Palm by using a technique called rainbowing -- a vessel dredging sand from the seabed and spraying and piling it onto the desired area and into the requested shape."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"the Strawberry,\" ", "answer_start": "380"}], "question": "What was the Barron's nickname?", "id": "554", "answers": [{"text": "\"the Strawberry,\" ", "answer_start": "380"}, {"text": "\"the Strawberry,\" ", "answer_start": "380"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what was his sentence", "id": "385c99c95a1d51241df88bdc13d93d2070eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "what did they sell", "id": "6100da668c32a7d4851a297a9904e1c8171NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities said they have arrested the leader of a drug cartel that set off two grenades during a public celebration in September, killing eight people and wounding more than 100.\n\n\n\n\n\nCesar Duarte, president of the federal chamber of deputies, says he supports the government plan on narcotrafficking.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlberto Espinoza Barron, known as \"the Strawberry,\" heads the \"Michoacan Family,\" which operates in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Mexico, authorities said.

The money is helping pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion and a new sanctuary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're making a lot of millionaires up here in the Barnett Shale area,\" said Julie Wilson, vice president of Chesapeake Energy, one of the energy companies drilling wells in the Fort Worth area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce says the urban drilling craze has created more than 50,000 jobs and will pump nearly $1 billion in tax revenue into the city's economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut opponents of this urban drilling say that it shouldn't be done in populated areas and that the promises of many people getting rich aren't true. They say that for most people, the payouts are modest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found. The dollar figure also depends on each resident's negotiating skills with energy companies, experts say. The money can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet. Hush money is what I call it,\" said Don Young, a community activist who operates a blog called FWCanDo.org. \"Gas drilling is very dirty; it's very dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo 72-year-old Jerry Horton, the drilling is a threat to her cherished front yard. To move the natural gas through the city, Chesapeake Energy needs to bury a pipeline in her yard. She's been offered almost $13,000, up from the $3,000 she was initially offered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't sell my front yard for a million dollars,\" said Horton, a retired artist who has lived in the same house for 53 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nChesapeake Energy recently sued Horton for access to her front yard, claiming eminent domain. The company says pipelines are crucial to keep the natural gas flowing and allow people to cash in the profits under the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand we need to pump our own oil, our own gas,\" Horton said. \"But we don't need to destroy our homes, all of our trees and blow ourselves up. Who's going to be here to enjoy the gas then?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy companies say that drilling for natural gas is safe and done in an environmentally friendly way. But opponents say the drilling is dangerous and a threat to the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gas drilling ... has no business in an urban area. So I don't want to contribute to a company that's doing that to my community,\" said Young, who refused to let his property be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile energy companies maintain the drilling is not a threat to homes, some question the impact of drilling beneath neighborhoods. Young and other activists also are concerned about air and water pollution, soil contamination, health and safety issues and the loss of green space and wildlife.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're guinea pigs,\" Young said. \"We're the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood, right in the heart of the city.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text":

halt on Saturday when the defending champions were held to a 1-1 draw at Stoke City.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited had won five matches in a row, and took the lead through a superb individual goal from midfielder Nani in the 27th minute as the Portugal international waltzed into the box and drilled in a low shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the industrious home side never gave up and claimed a point against the 19-time English champions for the first time in the Premier League thanks to a 52nd-minute header from big-money August signing Peter Crouch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lanky former Tottenham striker got between central defenders Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand to nod home from a corner as United goalkeeper David De Gea was left helpless on his line.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited went into the match without England striker Wayne Rooney, who wrote on Twitter that he expects to return from injury for Tuesday's Champions League visit by Swiss side Basel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis regular forward partner Javier Hernandez is a doubt for that match after coming off in the first half against Stoke having fallen hard on his head when he tumbled following a tussle with Jonathan Woodgate as the Mexican sought to score.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat left United with last season's top scorer Dimitar Berbatov up front alongside Michael Owen, who scored twice in midweek in the League Cup but failed to make the same impression.\n\n\n\n\n\nBerbatov was similarly ineffectual and was later replaced by Danny Welbeck as United battled in vain to win the match.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result left United on 16 points, above local rivals Manchester City only on goal difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nCity earlier briefly topped the table as second-half goals from substitutes Mario Balotelli and James Milner ended Everton's run of victories in their last four visits to Eastlands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalotelli broke the deadlock in the 68th minute after replacing Edin Dzeko, with his shot taking a deflection off Everton defender Phil Jagielka.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian then set up David Silva, whose effort was ruled out for offside -- and the Spanish playmaker also earlier hit the woodwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nSilva provided City's second with a minute to play as he sent England midfielder Milner clear after an error by Everton's former Real Madrid winger Royston Drenthe, who came on as a substitute.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalotelli's return to form will give manager Roberto Mancini a selection dilemma ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Bayern Munich.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Fernando Torres was both hero and villain as third-placed Chelsea beat promoted Swansea 4-1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Spain striker scored his second goal in two games after a long drought to put the London side ahead on the half hour, but was sent off before halftime for a bad tackle on Mark Gower -- his first red card in the Premier League.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was another mixed weekend for the $80 million former Liverpool player, who also netted in the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United before an extraordinary miss that saw him widely lampooned.\n\n\n\n\n\nRamires had already made it 2-0 before Torres departed, and the Brazil midfielder doubled his tally in the 76th minute before Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed in Gower's freekick.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute Didier Drogba sealed victory deep into stoppage time to boost his hopes of starting in Wednesday's Champions League trip to Valencia.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewcastle retained fourth place with a 3-1 victory over Blackburn, who remained in the relegation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenegal striker Demba Ba scored his first hat-trick in English football before being replaced by France midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his league comeback after almost a year out with a broken leg.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifth-placed Liverpool bounced back from the 4-0 trouncing at Tottenham by beating mid-table Wolverhampton 2-1 at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Adam was sent off last weekend but this time his 11th-minute shot produced an own-goal by defender Roger Johnson, and striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 before halftime.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute striker Steven Fletcher gave Wolves hope four minutes after the break, but Kenny Dalglish's team held on as England midfielder Steven Gerrard continued his comeback from long-term injury when he was introduced late in the match.\n\n\n\n\n\nTottenham closed to within a point of Liverpool, having played one fewer match, after a 2-1 win at Wigan.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew signing Emmanuel Adebayor set up Dutch midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart in just the third minute, then Gareth Bale headed home Luka Modric's 23rd-minute corner to make it 2-0.\n\n\n\n\n\nStriker Mohamed Diame reduced the deficit five minutes after halftime but Wigan defender Steve Gohouri was sent off for a second booking for a foul on winger Bale as Spurs held on for a third successive victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal moved out of the relegation zone and up to 12th place with a 3-0 win over 10-man Bolton that left the visitors rock bottom after five successive defeats.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin van Persie's second-half double gave the Dutch forward 100 goals for the London club, while Alex Song curled home late on.\n\n\n\n\n\nBolton had defender David Wheater sent off with the score at 1-0 after tugging back England forward Theo Walcott, who later limped off.\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Brom and Fulham remained in the bottom four after a 0-0 draw at the Hawthorns which left the visiting London side still seeking a first victory this season."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "86 ", "answer_start": "118"}], "question": "How much passengers had fallen?",

InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year.\n\nAccording to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade.\n\nAntonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.\n\n\"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"\n\nJames Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.\n\n\"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"\n\nHe said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.\n\n\"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.\n\nFarming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.\n\nHowever, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.\n\nAccording to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.\n\nCosta said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.\n\nHe called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.\n\n\"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.\n\nAppathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.\n\n\"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion.\n\n\n\nIt is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds.\n\n\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper.\n\n\n\n\"This came totally out of the blue,\" Mankin said.\n\n\n\nThere were no indications of violence around the ranch, he said.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill.\n\n\n\nThe church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona -- but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south.\n\n\n\nCritics of the sect say that it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13 and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else.

But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts.\n\n\n\nAva Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies.\n\n\n\n\"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\"\n\n\n\nThe recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit.\n\n\n\nRestaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests.\n\n\n\nBut with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\"\n\n\n\nSo far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities.\n\n\n\nA common but mysterious condition\n\n\n\nOne out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind.\n\n\n\nExperts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said.\n\n\n\nThe majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods.\n\n\n\nBut for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAfter one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack. But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis.\n\n\n\nEnjoying food in spite of allergies\n\n\n\nMiller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals, whether at Thanksgiving or on a date, without feeling sick. She runs her own coaching practice, blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc.\n\n\n\nShe herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow's milk, and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts. She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon, lemon grass, eggplant, some types of melons and most tropical fruits.\n\n\n\nBut Miller, now 36, did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants. She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs, and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems.\n\n\n\n\"It is both worry-free for the diner and worry-free for the restaurant,\" she said. \"Restaurants appreciate that I'm looking out for them as well ... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time.\"\n\n\n\nWhere everybody knows your name\n\n\n\nSo how does someone like Miller, who lives with food allergies plus a \"wheat/gluten-free, processed sugar-free, lactose-free, soy-free, low processed food-free lifestyle,\" safely enjoy eating out?\n\n\n\nMiller calls it the \"Cheers\" experience. The first time she goes to a restaurant, she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation.\n\n\n\nOnce at the restaurant, she'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs. Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu. By this point, Miller says, everyone has been introduced by name.\n\n\n\nAfter the meal, Miller thanks the server, chef and manager, and tips the server generously. She'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely.\n\n\n\nOn her blog, allergicgirl.blogspot.com, Miller finds no shortage of restaurant meals to recommend and photograph. She'll find creative alternatives to traditionally prepared foods that look no less appetizing than more familiar versions -- for instance, she recently had fish-free sushi made of potato tempura, sticky rice, avocado and sesame seeds.\n\n\n\nNot every restaurant will accommodate Miller's special needs -- she has been refused service at some restaurants. But in general, she's found that restaurants have become far more understanding than five years ago, if only because staff members have children with food allergies.\n\n\n\n\"That changes how they run their kitchen,\" she said. \"More and more people are touched by this, and do get it.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "of ", "answer_start": "768"}], "question": "another wounded in Dallas rush hour Monday", "id": "2034", "answers": [{"text": "of ", "answer_start": "768"}, {"text": "state ", "answer_start": "780"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Brian Smith was hospitalized in serious condition after a suicide attempt", "id": "575fefa206d6f924707a30db1217c3c6b6eNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Utah officer was tied to at least three of four Dallas shootings", "id": "777eb1cb6249f2f4c14beb89da69e77ae0dNONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN)  -- The former Utah state trooper suspected in a series of roadway shootings earlier this week died Wednesday, the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said.\n\n\n\nCNN affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah, provided this file photo of the Dallas suspect, Brian Smith.\n\n\n\nPolice said Tuesday that Brian Smith attempted suicide after Monday's shootings.

The girls could not risk talking about Taliban harassment, because the militants' version of Islamic law lingers. Such Islamic law, or shariah, also keeps females from going to school or going outside without their husbands.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during fighting that started in April.

A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed.\n\n\n\nAccording to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8\u00bd months pregnant, and wrote the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski.\n\n\n\nThe following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAll of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman.\n\n\n\nAtkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.\n\n\n\nAtkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children.\n\n\n\nLast month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there.

Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one who has followed Cain's astonishingly successful presidential campaign would be surprised to hear that he uses blunt language and gestures to express himself. The question of whether this blunt language constituted true sexual harassment may never be known.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe claimant represented by attorney Joel Bennett, and recently identified as a federal government employee, has refused to go public despite the National Restaurant Association's highly unusual decision to release her from the negotiated confidentiality agreement. The second and third women remain anonymous, while Bialek surfaces with very old, never formally reported claims. In a court of law, Cain would clearly win.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in this case we are not litigating a claim but selecting a president. The American public, exercising its common sense about the character and integrity of this presidential candidate, will be the only and final judge of the facts of this case. Given the secrecy of the sex harassment litigation process and the grave difficulty in determining the truth of old and moldy claims, it looks like a hung jury is the likely outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Callan."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "Ferraris, ", "answer_start": "656"}], "question": "What brand were most of the sport cars?", "id": "1003", "answers": [{"text": "Ferraris, ", "answer_start": "656"}, {"text": "Lamborghini ", "answer_start": "668"}, {"text": "Acura NSX ", "answer_start": "687"}, {"text": "Ferraris, ", "answer_start": "656"}, {"text": "Lamborghini ", "answer_start": "668"}, {"text": "Acura NSX ", "answer_start": "687"}, {"text": "Ferraris, ", "answer_start": "656"}, {"text": "Lamborghini ", "answer_start": "668"}, {"text": "Acura NSX ", "answer_start": "687"}], "validated_answers": NaN}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "how much are making annual road?", "id": "528d8980913ba7e46c399457dcaa1590be2NONE", "answers": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "(CNN)  -- Stop, speed racers, stop.\n\n\n\nPolice say the cars were pulled over on a dangerous stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde, Oregon.\n\n\n\nSo said Oregon State Senior Trooper David Petersen after he was able to catch up with six exotic sports cars on a stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde on Thursday, according to a news release.\n\n\n\nPerhaps a more amazing feat was that he stopped all the cars simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\"They just were all good little soldiers and pulled right over,\" Oregon State Police spokesman Lt.

-- Asashoryu stands at the pinnacle of sumo wrestling like a colossus.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu is one of sumo's most successful, and most controversial, wrestlers.\n\n\n\nBut the 330-lbs Mongolian, sumo's most successful ever grand champion, has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset Japan's national sport in recent years.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, grew up in Mongolia, where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers.\n\n\n\nMoving to Japan as a student he was spotted and trained by the Takesago stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999.\n\n\n\nWinning his first tournament, or basho, in 2002, his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of Grand Champion, or yokozuna, in January 2003, becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport's 2,000-year-old history.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year.\n\n\n\nWhile Asashoryu's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity, his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone.\n\n\n\nSome have complained that his wins are too routine, and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of \"hinkaku,\" the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna, or give the sport's traditions the necessary respect.\n\n\n\nIn 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top-knot of an opponent, and has gained a reputation as the enfant-terrible of sumo.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the criticisms of Asashoryu's wrestling style, sumo's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports.\n\n\n\nWith deep links to Japanese culture going back to when sumo was part of the Shinto religious rituals, the sport's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis.\n\n\n\nFollowing the banning of three non-Japanese wrestlers for using recreational drugs in September, the sport's chairman and former-wrestler Kitanoumi resigned.\n\n\n\nIt came after a period of years in which a number of match-fixing allegations were made, some directly implicating Asashoryu, and plunging the sport into yet another crisis.\n\n\n\nIn January 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts, compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport.\n\n\n\nProblems for Asashoryu continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor's note and was restricted from leaving his house in Tokyo, leading to reports of a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\nMental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport, but while the punishing physical routine and \"hazing\" in the training stables has been known and accepted, tragedy struck earlier this year.\n\n\n\nTakashi Saito, a 17-year-old sumo trainee, died in brutal circumstances, allegedly beaten to death by his stable-master and three fellow sumo wrestlers.\n\n\n\nContinuing to make his mark in the dohyo will be Asashoryu's aim for the rest of the year, while sumo hopes it can recover its own poise."}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "\"Oprah: A Biography,\" ", "answer_start": "168"}],

So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.\n\n\n\nAnd so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.\n\n\n\nCNN: You're in a unique position.

When I prepared with Rep.

Fahrrad am Bahnhof (49-4651/5803), in Westerland's main train station, has a terrific rental selection, and the staff will happily suggest a route along Sylt's 136 miles of well-laid-out paths.\n\n\n\nGetting there\n\n\n\nSylt is reached by train from Berlin (5 hours) or Hamburg (3 1/2 hours). By car, take the autobahn to Nieb\u00fcll from Berlin (290 miles) or Hamburg (120 miles). There is no road connecting Sylt to the mainland; vehicles board a train for the 30-minute trip to the island. For more, see bahn.de.\n\n\n\nPlanning a beach getaway?

Israel handed the United Nations Friday a report justifying its actions during last year's Gaza campaign and rebutting the so-called \"Goldstone Report\" as biased.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a tree-planting ceremony southern Israel Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said, \"This report stresses that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is like no other army, both from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Goldstone Report is a distorted, false, and irresponsible report,\" Barak said. \"All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update\" -- a follow-up of a July paper on the Gaza mission -- is in response to the United Nations' call for both the Jewish state and the Palestinian Hamas movement to conduct independent inquiries to examine charges that both sides committed war crimes during the course of the Gaza war fought just over a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's 46-page response outlines the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of its three-week offensive -- dubbed Operation Cast Lead -- in Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael says it faced \"asymmetric conflicts\" and blamed \"militants operating from within and behind civilian areas\" for placing civilians at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military has \"launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,\" according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Israel is committed to ensuring that every such incident is fully and fairly investigated, to ensure that lessons can be learned and that, if justified, criminal or disciplinary proceedings initiated,\" the report stated. \"To this end the IDF policy requires that every allegation of wrongdoing be investigated, irrespective of its source.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report does not mention whether Israel will conduct an independent, non-military investigation of the charges of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity leveled in the Goldstone Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased in September, the 575-page report written by a commission chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone alleged that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and may have also committed crimes against humanity during the course of fighting that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of criticism in the report was reserved for Israel which has waged an aggressive international public relations campaign to discredit the probe's findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the publication of the report, the United Nations asked both Israel and Hamas to initiate independent investigations into the the various allegations and report back before February 5 when the General Assembly will be taking up the report and its recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those recommendations were the call for the report's findings to be passed on to the International Criminal Court if both sides did not start legitimate investigations into war crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Israel, the military has conducted investigations into possible wrong-doing itself which has raised criticism from human rights groups and some Israeli lawmakers that a more credible investigation is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's outgoing attorney-general Menachem Mazuz told the Haaretz newspaper Friday \"Israel has a clear interest in conducting a serious, expert examination that will deal with the (Goldstone) report and produce an opposing report.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement this week released a 20-page summary of the steps it has taken to investigate wrong-doing, contending it had prevented militants from rocketing Israeli civilians and that any examples to the contrary were a result of mistaken fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a claim quickly dismissed by the by human rights organizations and the Israeli government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,\" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were

Bush told a global climate change conference Friday that the United States will do its part to improve the environment by taking on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush Friday tells a global climate change conference \"we take this issue seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\"We take this issue seriously,\" he said at the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change, which the White House sponsored.\n\n\n\nIn his address, Bush called on \"all the world's largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, including developed and developing nations,\" to come together and \"set a long-term goal for reducing\" greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\n\"By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,\" he said.  Watch Bush address the climate conference \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"By next summer, we will convene a meeting of heads of state to finalize the goal and other elements of this approach, including a strong and transparent system for measuring our progress toward meeting the goal we set. ... Only by doing the necessary work this year will it be possible to reach a global consensus at the U.N. in 2009.\"\n\n\n\nBush said it will be up to each nation to \"design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this long-term goal.\"\n\n\n\nHe said new technology, such as clean coal technology and biofuels, could help reduce greenhouse gases. He also called for more use of nuclear, wind and solar power.\n\n\n\n\"It was said that we faced a choice between protecting the environment and producing enough energy. Today we know better,\" the president said. \"These challenges share a common solution: technology.\"\n\n\n\n\"We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We know this can be done,\" Bush said. \"Last year, America grew our economy while also reducing greenhouse gases.\"\n\n\n\nIf the preliminary numbers stand, it would make 2006 the first time in Bush's presidency that greenhouse emissions dropped.\n\n\n\nIn prepared remarks this week, Assistant Secretary of Energy Karen Harbert said, \"Preliminary data for 2006 suggests an absolute reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 1.3 percent for that year despite economic growth of 2.9 percent.\"\n\n\n\nIn previous years, the administration also has said its policies were reducing greenhouse emissions, but Department of Energy figures through 2005 show emission figures went up each year.\n\n\n\nThe administration also said during those years it was reducing \"greenhouse emissions intensity,\" a term referring to the ratio between emissions and the size of the economy. The administration said the economy was growing at a faster rate than the emissions themselves.\n\n\n\nWhile the White House has taken heat for its environmental policies -- including from some Republicans such as Sen. John McCain -- Bush said at the conference Friday, \"By working together, we will set wise and effective policies.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"I want to get the job done. We have identified a problem -- let's go solve it together.\"\n\n\n\nOther nations have been critical of the Bush administration's policy on climate change after the United States withdrew from the 1997 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n\n\nThat protocol, which was signed by more than 150 countries,  called on industrialized nations to cut greenhouse emissions in absolute terms. It did not make that demand of developing nations. The protocol expires in 2012.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of 16 countries, the United Nations and the European Union are attending this week's two-day conference. The Bush administration has billed it as an initiative to develop a common approach to combat global warming following  Kyoto's collapse.\n\n\n\nAt a Group of Eight conference in June, Bush pushed for a new framework on global gas emissions to counter the effects of global warming.\n\n\n\nBush said he believes every nation should set its own goals. The president expressed concern that setting strict targets would damage the U.S. economy. Instead, he said, industries should enact voluntary measures.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also told delegates to the global climate change conference that countries around the world must work together to combat climate change, much as they cooperate against terror and the spread of disease.\n\n\n\n\"No one nation, no matter how much power or political will it possesses, can succeed alone,\" she said. \"We all need partners, and we all need to work in concert.\"\n\n\n\nRice said the United States takes climate change seriously, \"for we are both a major economy and a major emitter.\"\n\n\n\nIn her address to the Major Economies Meeting, Rice said an integrated response, including \"environmental stewardship, economic growth, energy supply and security and development and the development and deployment of new clean energy technology,\" is the key to moving forward on the issue.

Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.\n\n\n\nAsiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.\n\n\n\nAccording to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.\n\n\n\nSaudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.\n\n\n\nSPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"\n\n\n\nAsiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.\n\n\n\nSome of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.\n\n\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "planning processes are urgently needed ", "answer_start": "2042"}], "question": "What does the advocate say?", "id": "1803", "answers": [{"text": "planning processes are urgently needed ", "answer_start": "2042"}], "validated_answers": "{\"2042:2081\": 2}"}], "context": "(CNN) -- We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control: Commutes back up, smog thickens, and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces.\n\n\n\nThe oceans are growing crowded, and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use.\n\n\n\nBut what about \"ocean sprawl\"?\n\n\n\nUntil recently, no one gave that idea much thought. But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\"The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,\" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world.\"\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies.\n\n\n\nA handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems.\n\n\n\nInternationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\n\n\n\nOcean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming.\n\n\n\nOne reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group.\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,\" Whitehouse said. \"So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface.\"\n\n\n\nBeneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century.\n\n\n\nThe energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space.\n\n\n\nIn Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nWhat happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, pavement on land creates \"expressways\" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. \"Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,\" the report says.\n\n\n\nWhen the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,\" she said, \"but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans.\"\n\n\n\nSince there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He added, \"There's not enough space for everything, and there are going to have to be trade-offs that are made.\"\n\n\n\nCurrent efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts, Ehler said.\n\n\n\nUntil now, the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of \"free-for-all\" in which \"whoever gets there first gets the access,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLeland, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem.\n\n\n\nMore than 140 federal laws govern the ocean's use; and six federal departments, along with dozens of agencies, are in charge of implementing those laws, according to the Pew Oceans Commission report.\n\n\n\nCharles M. Wahle, a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Obama's ocean-planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking.\n\n\n\n\"We're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways,\" he said. \"They all have standing, and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"Fifty years from now, you should be able to go to a place [in the ocean] and know what will be happening there.\"\n\n\n\nThere are skeptics of the shift.\n\n\n\nCommercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups, said Jim Ruhle, president of Commercial Fishermen of America, an industry group.\n\n\n\n\"We make our livelihoods from that ocean, and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSome other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses, like offshore wind energy, entirely.\n\n\n\nDespite this new emphasis on planning, there's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities.\n\n\n\n\"The proof will be in the pudding,\" said Wahle, of NOAA.\n\n\n\nBut he said it's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking.\n\n\n\n\"If we do our jobs right, overall, the oceans will be healthier, ecosystems will be more productive, people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems,\" he said, \"and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work.\""}, {"qas": [{"answer": [{"text": "education, infrastructure, energy ", "answer_start": "398"}], "question": "what  Obama offers?", "id": "409", "answers": [{"text": "$60 billion on America's infrastructure.\n", "answer_start": "254"}, {"text": "spend billions to improve ", "answer_start": "362"}, {"text": "education, infrastructure, energy ", "answer_start": "398"}, {"text": "health care ", "answer_start": "436"}, {"text": "economy, ", "answer_start": "104"}, {"text": "proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation's ", "answer_start": "50"}], "validated_answers": "{\"398:432\": 2, \"bad_question\": 1}"}, {"answer": [{"text": "NIL", "answer_start": -1}], "question": "Sen.

That giveaway didn't meet demand, though, and as of late January, more than 3.2 million people were on the program's waiting list.\n\n\n\nMore than 6.5 million U.S. households, or 5.7 percent, were not ready for the crossover last month, according to an estimate from the Nielsen Company.\n\n\n\nThere's been little made of the people behind those numbers, though, as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen.

He's given up luxuries like cable TV, an Internet connection and movie rentals to make ends meet.\n\n\n\nHe said he applied for the free converter about a month ago but was turned down at least temporarily because all of the coupons had been given out.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't buy the idea that he needs a television to alert him about emergencies or severe weather.\n\n\n\n\"I do have a radio and I also have a cell phone. If something's really, really bad, someone can call me,\" he said. \"And I figure if there's a nuclear war, it will be everywhere. Someone will let me know.\"\n\n\n\nIf Richter eventually gets a free converter box, he'll consider joining the digital TV world. But if not, he said won't be angry at the government for the delays.\n\n\n\nHe thinks he might be better off without all that extra noise."}]}]}
